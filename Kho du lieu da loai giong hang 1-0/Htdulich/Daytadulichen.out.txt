I'm still not sure about this.
Let me assure you, Ms White.
I have a tourism qualification and I've been doing this job for seven years.
But…

At six we'll have a traditional dinner and then go to the parade.
Excellent.

I mean your wife and kids!
Oh, I'm not married.
Oh really?
Excuse me, Mona, Leo?

Mona, I think I might walk down to the beach.
Tell me about the moon, Leo.
Well, the legend goes…that there's an old man on the moon…
Tell me about the moon, Leo.
Well, the legend goes that there's an old man on the moon who has the names of all the newborn babies.

Leo, where's my father?
Your father
I can't see him anywhere.
Why weren't you watching?
Excuse me!
He's not here!
We must call the police.
That may not be necessary.
Your father is a very smart man, Ms.White.
I'm sure he knows his way back.
Let's check the hotel first.
Lesson 21: Dealing with a situation
Excuse me, Justine?
Ms.White, from Room 311, would like to speak to you.
Certainly. How can I help you, Ms.White?
My father is missing.
Your receptionist lost him!

It must be very upsetting for you, Ms.White.
May I suggest you come to my office?
I can see this is very serious.
It must be very upsetting for you, Ms.White.
Let me see if I understand you clearly.
You were at the festival with your father?

Leo?
I was their tour guide.
I see.
So what you are saying is that you were separated from your father?
Yes.
Had you arranged a meeting place, Leo?

Can I just say that you have a very good worker in Leo.
He's been more than helpful.
Hasn't he, Mona?
Oh, I'm sorry I blamed you, Leo but I was very upset.
Maybe, we should all go to the lounge and calm down.
Thank you for your kind invitation, Ms.White, but I must go home now.

Oh, this isn't right.
Leo, this laundry bill seems too much.
Let me see.
Hmm.
That's for emergency dry cleaning.
I can't remember any dry cleaning.
Repairs to your hat, Ms White.
Sixty dollars?
It was cleaned at very short notice and on a holiday.
However, I can query it if you like.
No, that's OK.
Here are your invoices.
Do you need a minute to look over them?
However, I can query it if you like.
Leo, I have a query.
This amount, under newspapers.
Ah yes.
I see the problem.

I'm Justine Asker, the manager.
You can call me Justine.
Pleased to meet you.
Sit down.
Firstly, Bob, can I ask which job you are applying for?
I'm applying for the receptionist position.
I see that you have a diploma in Hospitality.
Have you done any front desk work before?
I have work experience in front desk.
You have my supervisor's report there.
This will be my first paid position.
And why do you want to work at the Plaza Hotel?
Because it has a great reputation; not just for its service but as a good place to work.
I'm glad to hear it.
Come in, Bob.
I'm Justine Asker, the manager.
You can call me Justine.
Sit down.
Firstly, Bob, can I ask which job you are applying for?

And why do you want to work at the Plaza Hotel?
Because it has a great reputation; not just for its service but as a good place to work.
Bob, what strengths do you think you would bring to the job?
Oh, ah.
I am patient and I've been told I put clients at ease.
Uh huh..
And what do you see as your weaknesses?
Do you mean, what am I not so good at?
Yes.
Well, I understand English much better than I speak it at the moment.
But I study at home and I look forward to learning more on the job.
Excellent.
Well, I understand English much better than I speak it at the moment.
But I study at home and I look forward to learning more on the job.
And what do you see as your weaknesses?
Do you mean, what am I not so good at?
Yes.
Now, Bob, I'm going to ask you a hypothetical question.
Would you compromise your own safety for the comfort of your guests?
Do you mean, like the Legendary Leo, who jumped into shark infested waters to save a guest's hat?
Something like that.
If I must.
I don't think you would be expected to show that level of enthusiasm, Bob.
Leo was an exceptional worker, but very impetuous.
In that case, I would make sure I know the health and safety requirements associated with my position and follow hotel procedures.
Very good.
Now, is there anything you would like to ask me?
Yes, I was wondering if anyone has heard what happened to Leo?
I mean questions relating to this position, Bob.
Oh, of course.
Um Yes, I would like to know if the hours of duty are flexible.
Yes, we have three shifts, and there is also overtime work available when we're very busy.
That's good.
I'm very impressed with your qualifications Bob.
We'll ring you and let you know the outcome tomorrow morning.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
