But we can go to the zoo anywhere, Mona.
Leo, what's something we can only see in this city?
Well, you're in luck.
The Lantern Festival parade is on tomorrow.
It's very colourful.
Is it near the harbour?
I'd love to see the harbour.
We have harbours in Australia, Mona.
Now, what did you have in mind?
The Lantern Festival parade is on tomorrow.
Perhaps this will interest you.
It's a dolphin watch harbour cruise.
How much will that set us back, Leo?
As you can see, the price is very reasonable.
Oh this looks good.
It's going to be fine and sunny tomorrow.
Perfect for a cruise.
I think I'd like to see the parade.
You can do both!
The cruise takes four hours and the parade doesn't start until after sunset.

All right. Let's go over our itinerary.
We'll take the morning cruise and then have lunch at the quay.
After that, we can visit the temples or you can come back and rest, depending on how you feel.
Yes, let's play that by ear.
At six we'll have a traditional dinner and then go to the parade.
Excellent.
What time should we start out?
We should leave the hotel at about 7.30.
Don't forget to bring your camera and it's a good idea to wear warm clothes.
It can get quite chilly on the ferry.
Don't forget to bring your camera… and it's a good idea to wear warm clothes.

There's a kiosk on the ferry but I can ask the kitchen to make up something to take with you if you prefer.
Thanks Leo, some sandwiches would be great.
I'll make the arrangements now.
See you in the lobby at 7.30.

I mean your wife and kids!
Oh, I'm not married.
Oh really?
Excuse me, Mona, Leo?

Mona, I think I might walk down to the beach.
Tell me about the moon, Leo.
Well, the legend goes…that there's an old man on the moon…
Tell me about the moon, Leo.
Well, the legend goes that there's an old man on the moon who has the names of all the newborn babies.
He knows who will marry whom.
Look around you.
People are making wishes to him.
It's said that he will grant your wish.
Really? That's interesting.
Oh, Leo, I'm sorry I have been so rude to you.
Not at all.
No, I have been rude.
You've been patient and wise and brave
It's nice of you to say so.

Leo, where's my father?
Your father
I can't see him anywhere.
Why weren't you watching?
Excuse me!
He's not here!
We must call the police.
That may not be necessary.
Your father is a very smart man, Ms.White.
I'm sure he knows his way back.
Let's check the hotel first.
Lesson 21: Dealing with a situation
Excuse me, Justine?
Ms.White, from Room 311, would like to speak to you.
Certainly. How can I help you, Ms.White?
My father is missing.
Your receptionist lost him!

I can see this is very serious.

It must be very upsetting for you, Ms.White.
May I suggest you come to my office?

I was their tour guide.
I see.
So what you are saying is that you were separated from your father?
Yes.
Had you arranged a meeting place, Leo?
Yes I had.
But that's where we were standing when we lost him.
Is your father elderly, Ms.White?

And you are Ms.White's father?

Can I just say that you have a very good worker in Leo.
He's been more than helpful.
Hasn't he, Mona?
Oh, I'm sorry I blamed you, Leo but I was very upset.
Maybe, we should all go to the lounge and calm down.
Thank you for your kind invitation, Ms.White, but I must go home now.
And I must go to the Pearl Garden Cabaret.

Leo, this laundry bill seems too much.
Let me see.
Hmm.
That's for emergency dry cleaning.
I can't remember any dry cleaning.
Repairs to your hat, Ms White.
Sixty dollars?
It was cleaned at very short notice and on a holiday.
However, I can query it if you like.
No, that's OK.

And what do you see as your weaknesses?
Do you mean, what am I not so good at?
Yes.
Now, Bob, I'm going to ask you a hypothetical question.

Do you mean, like the Legendary Leo, who jumped into shark infested waters to save a guest's hat?
Something like that.
If I must.
I don't think you would be expected to show that level of enthusiasm, Bob.
Leo was an exceptional worker, but very impetuous.
In that case, I would make sure I know the health and safety requirements associated with my position and follow hotel procedures.
Very good.
Now, is there anything you would like to ask me?
Yes, I was wondering if anyone has heard what happened to Leo?
I mean questions relating to this position, Bob.
Oh, of course.
Um Yes, I would like to know if the hours of duty are flexible.
Yes, we have three shifts, and there is also overtime work available when we're very busy.
That's good.
I'm very impressed with your qualifications Bob.
We'll ring you and let you know the outcome tomorrow morning.
Thank you.
Goodbye.

ARCHITECTURAL SYMBOLS
The Palace's design reflects the ways in which its architect Ngô Viết Thụ took inspiration from his knowledge of symbolic concepts derived from Eastern philosophy.
The building's overall structural plan is a rendering of an ancient Ideogram , meaning 'good fortune'.
The front elevation's openings kõu, symbolise truthful speech.
The placing of the flagstaff zhõng, symbolises 'unswerving fidelity'.
Three horizontal strokes illustrated by the roofing, fâcde and canopy sãn, symbolise the mystical triad humanity, wisdom and firmness of purpwe.
The three strokes united by a vertical with the flag situated above forms a character zhũ, signifying the power of the head of state.
The lines along the fâcde xìng, signify ‘prosperity’.
INDEPENDENCE PALACE
Declared a National Site in 1076, then Special National Site in 2009, the Independence Palace, which was first opened to the public in 1990, has been the scene of many of the most important and dramatic events in Viet Nam’s history.
Today’s Palace occupies the site of the former residence of the French colonial Governors General, designed by Achille-Antoine Hermitte and completed in 1871.
Following the 1945 Geneva Accords, the old structure, renamed Independence Palace, became the residence of the first President of the new Sai Gon Republic Ngo Dinh Diem, After a bomb attack on 27 February 1962, President Diem’s assassination in 1963.His successor Nguyen Van Thieu assumed the presidency in October 1967 and occupied the Palace until his abdication on 21 April 1975, when he has replaced by his Vice President Tran Van Huong, and then a week later by General Duong Van Minh.
On 30 April 1975, Liberation Forces antered the Palace grounds and raised the flag of liberation for the first time from its rooftop. General Duong Van Minh offerd his unconditional surrender. Victory had come. The liberation of the South had been achieved.
CABINET ROOM
The meetings held in this room induded sittings of the President and his minisfers.
By decree of President Thiệu in November 1967, the government consisted of the Prime Minister, 19 cabinet mintetefs and 7 deputy ministers.
From 1967 to 1975, there were 5 Cabinet reshuffles.
The longest was General Trln Thiện Khiêm, who remained in office for 6 years. The last serving cabinet and its Prime Minister Vũ Văn Mẫu were appointed on 29 April 1975 and were in the process of being formally presented to the President on 30 April at 10 am at the moment when radio Sàì Gòn was broadcasting President Dương Văn Minh’s statement of surrender confirming the end of hostilities and the transfer of power to the Provisional Revolutiomry Government of the Republic of South Việt Nam,
THE BOMBING OF THE PALACE
On 8 April 1975, an underground member of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Lieutenant Nguyễn Thành Trung, who had infiltrated the airforce of the Southern Republic, seized the opportunity provided by his assignment to fly a military mission to Phan Thiết.
Evading detection by the local control tower, Lt.Trung flew his F5E aircraft directly over Sài Gòn and succeeded in dropping two bombs on the Palace before landing at an improvised airstrip prepared by the Liberation Forces.
The helipad on the upper terrace of the Palace and the main central staircase were damaged in the attack, though they were subsequently repaired .
But this feat seriously undermined the republic's authority and prompted the US President to order the evacuation of the last of the Americans still in Sài Gòn.
CONFERENCE HALL
Receptions for as many as 500 guests were held in this room, which was also used for the installation of each new Cabinet.
At 19:30 on 21 April 1975, President Thiệu delivered his resignation speech ỉn this room: he spoke for over 2 hours about the country's situation in the wake of the Americans' decision to discontinue their support.
Vice President Trần Văn Hương then succeeded to the Presidency, pledging to continue the struggle “to the bitter end” He resigned just a week later, and was replaced by General Dương Văn Minh, from whom the revolutionary authorities received the formal declaration of surrender.
In November 1975, the Consultative Council for National Reunification used this room for its deliberations.
Today it is used for official receptions and other important events.
STATE BANQUETING HALL
State banquets with as many as 100 guests were held in this room.
One of the most notable such events was the inauguration dinner of President Nguyên Văn Thiệu and his Vice President Nguyễn Cao Kỳ on 31 October 1967.
The last State Dinner was held here by President Thiệu on 1 March 1975 for the us congressional delegation sent to report on the prospects for continued support for the southern government.
The room's gold colour scheme was intended to create a convivial atmosphere.
Its focal point is the massive painting in 7 sections by the Palace's architect Ngô Viết Thụ representing a scene from a poem in Chinese characters widely known and cherished as an evocation of national unity.
Its opening lines are "The land is as lovely as a length of brocade, all its growing thing's ripening in peace".
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBER
This room was used for meetings between the President and his senior officers and US advisers.
The walls are hung with maps documenting the war situation in the South.
On 25 March 1975 at 9:30am, faced with the continuing advance of the liberation forces, President Thiệu ordered his senior General Ngô Quang Trưởng to evacuate the city of Huế and mount a last-ditch defence at Đà Nẵng.
This prompted us President Gerald Ford to dispatch the last of the many fact-finding missions sent to report on the situation in the South.
On 3 April 1975, the delegation assembled in this room for a meeting with President Thiệu and his senior military leaders, seeking unsuccessfully to find a solution to the military impasse confronting them.
PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE
Nguyễn Văn Thiệu was born in 1923 in Tri Thủy village, Ninh Hải district, Ninh Thuận province.
He was trained at the national officer's school at Đà Lạt and subsequently in the USA and France.
Having taken part in the coup d’état tat against President Diệm in November 1963, he made a rapid rise to power, becoming Prime Minister with the associated portfolios of Minister of Defence and National Assembly President, then President of the Southern Republic in 1967.
Thiệu wrote to the US President on 25 March 1975 appealing for an air assault against the arIas under the control of the Vietnamese Revolutionary Forces and for continuing American support for the Southern Republic. His appeal was rejected.
He resigned on 21 April 1975 and then fled the country. He died in Boston, USA, in 2001.
PRESIDENTIAL RECEPTION ROOMS
In the first of the two presidential reception rooms, the President's chair is placed on a platform in front of a striped panel symbolising the flag of the Republic of Việt Nam.
Facing the President's throne-like seat is a chair intended for the guest of honour.
Both are carved with dragon's head motifs.
The other chairs are carved with a phoenix head or characters symbolising longevity.
The second room is considerably simpler.
Between 19 and 23 October 1972, six meetings were held in this room between President Thiệu and Henry Kissinger, President Nixon's National Security Advisor, during which Kissinger sought to persuade President Thiệu to accept the agreement which was eventually enacted as the Paris Peace Accords of January 1973.
AMBASSADORS CHAMBER
Before 1975, many countries had embassies in Sài Gòn.
Newly arrived ambassadors presented their credentials to the President in this room in the presence of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
The furnishings and pictures in the room are in fine Japanese-style lacquer-work, created by the artist Nguyễn Văn Minh.
The larger painting in 40 small panels entitled "Declaration of victory over the Ming” depicts a famous scene from the reign of King Lê Lợi.
The wall sconces were lit during ambassadorial presentation ceremonies.
On 18 April 1975 at 11:30am, President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu received the newly appointed Japanese Ambassador, Hiroshi Hitomi. This was the last such ceremony ever enacted in the Independence Palace.
FIRST LADY’S RECEPTION ROOM
The President's wife held receptions here, often entertaining the wives of visiting heads of State and leaders of various national and international organisations.
The lamps in the shape of flowers give the room a sense of peace and charm.
The décor features a distinctive pairing of two contrasting motifs: the three porcelain figures representing the traditional Gods of Happiness, Prosperity and Longevity and an abstract fresco in modem cubist style.
The wife of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, Mrs.Nguyễn Thị Mai Anh, was bom in 1930 in Mỹ Tho in Tiền Giang province, to a family of Catholic doctors.
She married Nguyễn Vãn Thiệu in 1951, when he was a serving army lieutenant; they had three children, a daughter, Nguyễn Thị Tuấn Anh and two sons, Nguyễn Quang Lộc and Nguyên Thiệu Long.
SALON OF THE 4 CARDINAL DIRECTIONS
This room "of the 4 cardinal directions of peace" was also known as the meditation room, and was intended by the architect Ngô Viết Thụ as a space in which the head of State would find the calm necessary to reflect with due care before taking decisions determining the country's future.
President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu transformed this space intended for meditative contemplation into a party room with space for the entertainment of 100 or more guests.
The dance floor was constructed from high-quality hard-wood and the windows were constructed from blast-proof glass 12mm in thickness.
On 30 April 1975 at 11:30am, Lieutenant Bùi Quang Thận raised the flag of the Provisional Revolutionary Government from the flagpole above this room, having first taken down the flag of the newly dissolved Republic of Việt Nam.
BUNKER
Designed by the Lt.Col.Phan Văn Điển, the construction of the Presidential bunker took 3 months.
72.5m long, 0.8 to 22.5m in width and with a depth of 0.6 to 2.5m, the rooms are linked by narrow passages and protected by reinforced concrete walls.
It consists of two sections.
The command centre has a depth of 0.6m and is protected by a concrete wall capable of resisting a 500kg blast.
Its telecommunication equipment was installed by the Americans in the 1960s.
The maximum security shelter; at a depth of 2.5m, has a blast wall capable of resisting explosions of up to 2,000kg.
A staircase gave the President direct access to the shelter from his 2nd-floor office.
During the bombing of the Palace on 8 April 1975 the President's whole family took refuge in the shelter.
COMMAND CENTRE
This heavily shielded area was used as an intelligence coordination centre.
The maps provided an overview of on-going military operations.
Map of Việt Nam (1) shows the country divided at the 17th Parallel as provided for by the 1954 Geneva Accords which partitioned the country into the Democratic Republic of Việt Nam in the North, and the Republic of Việt Nam in the South.
Map of South-Việt Nam (2) shows the famous supply network known as the Hồ Chí Minh Trail. The areas thought to be used as bases by the revolutionary forces are shown in orange.
This information was provided by aerial photography with further corroboration from secret intelligence operatives.
Map of North-Việt Nam (3) shows military activities in the northern military zones.
The room also displays a top secret RVN document (4) entitled: "Military Allied Personnel Statistics for 1968"
COMMUNICATIONS
This was the Palace's main receiving station for coded intelligence messages; it could also be used for national radio broadcasts in times of emergency. It could accommodate 41 staff including telegraphists, telex clerks and mobile radio operators whose task was to maintain contact with troop units in the field as well as communication with overseas embassies and diplomatic missions.
In 1968, an emergency national radio service transmitter was instilled in the Palace, initially to broadcast to the area around Sài Gòn - Gia Định, then enhanced with the addition of two l0 kw transmitters allowing for broadcasts to the whole of the Delta and Central Region, A 45m antenna was erected in the Palace garden.
Radio contact with Washington and other overseas contact with Wanshington and other overseas capitals was maintained via relay stations established at Phú Lâm in Sài Gòn.
KITCHEN
This was the kitchen for major event such as the banquet marking the inauguration of President Thiệu, as well as National Day celebrations and state banquet for distinguished visitors, H also provided for grand family occasions such as the wedding of thfe President’s daughter, The kitchen was furnished with what was the most luxurious of modern equipment, of a standard fit for a five-star hotel.
Among the more notable appliances the kitchen contained a massive freezer, elaborate smoke extractors above the oven, and a scale for weighing provisions with a capacity of up to 100kg.
On the mezzanine level on the left-hand fide of the Palace, there was a smaller kitchen to provide for the everyday requirements of the President and his family.

Will cuisine or marine tourism be the core of Vietnam tourism?
Building marine tourism brand or selecting culinary art as the core values of the Vietnamese tourism is still a matter of controversy.
At a recent seminar on building the strategy on brand development for Vietnam's tourism to 2025, with the vision to 2030, many experts contributed ideas to improve the competitiveness of Vietnam's tourism in the integration period.
Tourism brands
According to Le Tuan Anh, Deputy Director of the International Cooperation Department, Vietnam National Administration of Tourism, an important factor to influence the attraction of tourists is not the symbol or slogan but the value of tourism brand.
Many countries around the world have made great progress in the number of tourists thanks to success in branding construction.
For instance, the UK with the brand “Great Britain” built in 2012, which helped this country reach a new record of foreign tourists, with 34.4 million in 2014.
Adjacent to Vietnam, Thailand is also a good example for the development of successful tourism brand "Land of Smiles" associated with the logo "Amazing Thailand".
From 19 million of foreign visitors in 2011, the number of tourists to Thailand grew to 33 million in 2015.
There are many other countries that their tourism brands have been shaped and disseminated worldwide.
To describe American tourism in short words, travelers would say “quality”, for Japanese tourism, it will be “respect, meticulous”, for Italy it will be “romantic”.
In Southeast Asia, referring to Indonesia, people will think of the country with thousands of islands and resorts, for Malaysia, it is famous for shopping tourism, and Cambodia with cultural heritage.
Building brand for Vietnam’s tourism
In the development strategy of Vietnam's tourism brand to 2025 and the vision to 2030, the national tourism brand is defined to be associated with four product lines: sea and islands, culture, nature and urban.
Le Quoc Vinh, General Director of LeBros Media Group, said once the brand is identified, it is important how to market it.
Vinh also pointed out common mistakes in marketing destination brands: it is marketing to all and the use of common, trite language.
"We often focus on promoting the features of the destinations and forget the core factor - emotion," Vinh said, adding that Vietnam’s tourism advertising videos only tried to show off all landscapes of the countries, without creating the highlight or a clear message.
Some travel experts said to successfully build destination branding, Vietnam must find a core value, which must be a unique value, which makes Vietnam different from other countries in the region.
Vinh suggested: "Philip Kotler, the world famous marketing expert said that Vietnam is the kitchen of the world.
Therefore, the cuisine is one of the values that we can use to promote national tourism image."
Building the road of cuisine is also one of the objectives in the strategy to build Vietnam’s tourism brand.
According to tourism experts, the representative image of Vietnam’s tourism include:
1. Ha Long Bay (75%)
2. Hanoi (67%)
3. Food (63%)
4. Hoi An (58%)
5. HCM City (58%)
6. Mekong Delta (54%)
7. Hue (46%)
8. Ao Dai (Vietnamese traditional gown) (33%)
9. Sapa (29%)
10 Nha Trang (29%)
Cuisine of the Nung
The Nung live at higher elevations and have a tradition of self-sufficiency.
The Nung live close to nature and eat whatever they can grow or gather in the forest.
Some of their dishes have become specialties of Lang Son’s tourism.
The Nung grow both regular rice and glutinous rice.
Steamed rice is the main food in the daily meal, which also includes wild vegetables and beans.
In the summer they often have porridge for lunch.
The Nung prefer to fry vegetables and roots rather than boil them.
After frying, they may add water to make soup.
Nung cuisine is well represented by their typical New Year feast, which is considered a meal to counteract risks.
The year-end party of the Nung Phan Sinh in Lang Son province includes many dishes made from different kinds of meat, bamboo shoots, and vegetables.
Luong Van Bach, a Nung man who lives in Lang Son, said: “The Nung Phan Sinh in Lang Son have upheld their traditional New Year celebration.
They prepare various dishes that include duck.
They believe eating duck will banish bad luck and they will enjoy a lucky New Year.”
Duck is part of several different dishes. The most popular dish is duck with sour bamboo shoots.
Khau nhuc is a kind of braised pork belly seasoned with several kinds of herbs, such as cinnamon, anise, pepper, chili, and basil.
Khau nhuc is always served to guests and at parties for weddings, funerals, and longevity celebrations.
Seasoned with leaves of “mac mat”, a local sweet and aromatic plant, roasted duck and pork are two other popular dishes of the Nung and other ethnic groups in Lang Son, Cao Bang, and Bac Can province.
Nong Van Chi of Lang Son said: “Mac mat leaves are indispensable with roasted pork and duck.
The leaves are aromatic.
We also stuff “mac mat” fruit inside a suckling pig to bring out its flavor.”
Rice wine is always part of a festival, wedding, funeral, or birthday party.
The Tay, Nung, and Thai groups in northern provinces drink wine with their arms intertwined to show they will remain close to each other forever.
Over the years, Nung culture and cuisine have become tourism trademarks of Lang Son province.

Banh com – a fine treat of Hanoi
Hanoi is famous for its speciality green rice flake cakes which are sold in Hang Than street.
Hang Than is just among more than 20 culinary streets in Hanoi which has about 70 streets with their first name of Hang.
This 300 metre long street houses more than 30 green rice flake cake shops.
The Nguyen Ninh trademark is the oldest and most popular brand for green rice flake cake.
The name was established in 1865 by late Tran Thi Luan and adopted it’s current name of Nguyen Ninh in 1928.
There have been 5 generations of Nguyen Ninh making green rice flake cake so far, said Nguyen Thi Hiep, a fourth generation family member.
As explained, Nguyen means origin, Ninh is called after Yen Ninh village which is now Yen Ninh street, near Hang Than.
Therefore, Nguyen Ninh green rice flake cake means the cake originated from Yen Ninh village.
Nguyen Ninh’s secret of making the cake is its pure ingredients without additives and mixture.
Green rice flake cake is made of green rice flakes, green peas and sugar.
Green rice flakes must be from Vong and Lu villages (in the past) or from rice land of Thai Binh (at present) and green peas are carefully selected in Ha Tay province.
As tasting a green rice flake cake, especially made by Nguyen Ninh, one can experience the full flavour of simple villages, a very different and typical Hanoi speciality.
The Nung hamlets in Chi Lang, Lang Son
Tourists visiting the northern province of Lang Son are greatly impressed by the peaceful hamlets of the Nung dotting the valleys, hillsides, and river banks.
To Tuan introduces a Nung hamlet in Chi Lang commune. A Nung hamlet in Chi Lang district, Lang Son province
Chi Lang district, which is about 120 km northeast of Hanoi, covers dangerous terrain in a hard-to-access part of Lang Son province.
The Nung are the majority residents in all 19 communes of Chi Lang district.
Trieu Thuy Tien, an official working in Lang Son’s culture sector, says that, like the Nung in other localities, the Nung in Chi Lang have maintained their traditions and customs: “The Nung clans cluster in hamlets.
They share with the Kinh people a tendency to treasure their neighbors above distant relatives.
Relatives living far away are not as valuable as good people living next door who will give us whatever we ask for.
It shows a sense of mutual support in a close-knit community.”
The Nung prefer to live at high elevations.
On national highway 1A, we see a road sign that reads “Ai Chi Lang”, where we turn into a rough road that climbs up the mountain to the Nung area. 40 km later we arrive at Co Hương, Thằm Nà, and Suối Mạ hamlet, about 1,200 to 1,300 meters above sea level.
Our effort is rewarded with beautiful vistas of vast meadows where herds of goats and horses are grazing.
The Nung are often praised for their openness and warm welcome for strangers. Their lifestyle and cooking also make a good impression on visitors.
In recent years, besides their tradition of raising cattle, the Nung have grown cash crops and fruit trees.
In the 1980s some households piloted growing custard-apple trees.
Now it has become the main fruit tree which brings them a stable income.
Triệu Thị Nhất, a Nung woman in Chi Lăng commune, says: “My family grows rice, custard-apples, and raises cattle.
Our income comes mainly from growing custard-apples.
We can afford to build a new house and buy some home comforts.”
Social changes have affected the Nung community.
There are many new brick houses replacing earthen stilt houses.
One thing that has not changed is their tradition of unity and mutual support to escape poverty and become better-off.
What is Vietnam's tourism identity?
To describe American tourism in short words, travelers would say “quality”, for Japanese tourism, it will be “respect, meticulous”, for Italy it will be “longing, romantic and luxury”.
What words could be used to describe Vietnam’s tourism?
This was the question of Mr.Le Tuan Anh, Deputy Director of the International Cooperation Department of the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism (VNAT) at a seminar held at the Hanoi International Tourism Fair 2016.
"Vietnam’s tourism has never been able to touch the human heart like Thailand," said Le Quoc Vinh, CEO of Le Bros media group.
Citing a clip advertising Thai tourism in the modern style, entitled ihatethailand (I hate Thailand), which attracted millions of views on the social network, Vinh said that it is important to "find the brand soul" rather than just focusing on developing the brand reputation and brand communication.
Vietnam’s tourism promotional activities have only advertised landscapes while ignoring the core, the highest element of the brand – emotion, Vinh said.
In the strategic project on development of tourism products of Vietnam to 2025 and the vision to 2030, the logo and slogan of Vietnam’s tourism remained unchanged.
"The matter is not in the logo or the slogan because they do not create the value.
We have to convey the brand's values," said Le Tuan Anh.
"Eco-tourism is developed everywhere, but visitors do not think it is eco-tourism.
This affects the image of Vietnam’s tourism," said Ms. Do Thi Thanh Hoa, Deputy Director of the Institute of Tourism Development.
Vietnam's tourism brand to 2020, according to Hoa, must be marine and island tourism.
The subject of the Hanoi International Tourism Fair 2016 is also "Vietnam, the paradise of marine and island tourism".
"Compared with other countries with marine brand in the region, Vietnam still has many advantages thanks to the system of beautiful beaches, crystal sea water and smooth sand," said Hoa.
Nevertheless, representatives of some travel firms said all coastal provinces wanted to develop marine tourism but many beaches were still flooded by rubbish.
City tourism in Vietnam is not mentioned much, because Vietnam cannot compete with Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, with big cities and developed shopping tourism.
However, this is still seen as one of four typical products of the country's tourism in the future.
"The most important factor is the nuance, which makes Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Da Nang always the top three most attractive cities to foreign visitors in Vietnam," said Le Tuan Anh.
Many suggested that international visitors highly appreciate the culture, cuisine, friendly people, and daily life experience in Vietnam.
Street food of Vietnam like pho (noodles), nem ran (spring rolls), and banh mi have become famous worldwide.
Many world leading travel magazines also praised Vietnam’s food, even used the word "superpower".
Madame Ton Nu Thi Ninh once said "it is very bad if we do not promote Vietnam cuisine."
Colin Pine, CEO of Ho Tram Resort, a member of the Tourism Advisory Council, said it was necessary to research and clarify further the tourism brand of Vietnam.
"Vietnam has many special things.
The difference in climate and culture of the three regions is also an advantage to attract foreign travellers.
I personally have lived in Vietnam for more than 20 years because of the friendly people," he said.

The 7 natural wonders of Phu Yen
Mossy beaches, slender wooden bridges and countless ponds and streams in the coastal province of Phu Yen have been sights to behold since forever.
Phu Yen sits 561 kilometers to the north of Saigon, right above the famous Khanh Hoa Province that gave us the fabulous Nha Trang and its beaches.
Its seaside location offers a beauty that rivals fantasy film sets, and its low-profile status keeps it safe from the forces of mass tourism that have saturated many attractions.
Hybrid cohabitation between moss and sea defenses.
Moss, one of the most trustworthy indicators of time, finds perfect harmony covering the concrete embankments by the sea in Phu Yen.

Said to be the longest of its kind in Vietnam at 700 meters, from afar the bridge belies the weight it can carry.
La Vong fish - a favourite dish of Hanoian
The food is supposed to have been created by the Doan family.
According to Ngo Thi Tinh, a descendant of the 4th generation of the family, the family started the business of selling "cha ca" to earn money to support the family members and to have a meeting place for the Vietnamese people who wanted to fight against French colonialism.
The family food became a speciality of Hanoian people.
The grilled fish must be made from a kind of fresh water fish called hemibagrus because it has very few bones and the flesh is very tasty.
If hemibagrus is not available, we could make do with mudfish or snake-head fish.
Some connoiseurs may request for a special kind of fish called Anh Vu, which is available only in Viet Tri city at the turning point of the Bach Hac River.
Thin slices of Anh Vu fish are rolled with a kind of herb called "soi" then grilled to give an excellent flavour.
To make grilled fish, thin slices of fish have to be mixed with ginger, saffron, fermented cold rice, pepper and fish sauce; then placed on bamboo skewers and grilled on a burning charcoal stove right on the dinning tables.

8 interesting facts about Da Lat
Da Lat is not only a renowned tourist-resort city of Vietnam but also famous for unusual and interesting sites.
1. Linh Phuoc – the Buddhist temple of records
Linh Phuoc, located at 120 Trai Mat, Da Lat, is one of the most well-known pagodas in Vietnam with a 37-metre bell tower – the tallest in the country.
The main hall consists of colorful paintings regarding the story of Buddha from his birth until he obtained Nirvana and his death.
Linh Phuoc Pagoda, also called Ve Chai Pagoda, was built from debris of glass, pottery bowls and porcelain between 1949 and 1952 in a remote residential area of Da Lat City.
The pagoda is led by many Buddhist monks and was renovated by Monk Thich Tam Vi in 1990.
The pagoda has been managed by 4 Buddhist monks, including Mr.Thich Minh The (1951 – 1954), Mr.Thich An Hoa (1954 – 1956), Mr.Thich Quang Phat (1956 – 1959) and Mr.Thich Minh Duc (1959 – 1985).
Since 1985, Mr.Thich Tam Vi has managed the pagoda including a big restoration in 1990.
The remarkable feature of the pagoda is the Dragon - shaped design made from the broken pieces of glasses in accordance to the design of Khai Dinh's Tomb in Hue. In the main temple, there is a statue of Shakyamuni Buddhist with the height of 4.9m, sitting under the root of Bodhi tree.
Beside the pagoda, we can see a 49m Dragon flying around the garden.
In front of the sanctum, there is Da Bao tower with 27m height.
On two sides of the tower, bell and drum are put.
In the tower, there are some statues of Quan The Am Bodhisattva.

2. The nuclear reactor
This is the only nuclear reactor in Indochina, which is located at No.1 Nguyen Tu Luc, Da Lat city.
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Da Lat nuclear reactor has small capacity (500kW) but it works safely and at high economic efficiency.
The Da Lat Nuclear Reactor, formerly known as TRIGA Mark II reactor, was built in 1963 with the authorized maximum operation power level of 250kWt, but it ceased operation from 1968 to 1975.
With support from the former Soviet Union, Vietnam began to restore and expand the reactor in February 1982 and officially resumed operation on March 20, 1984, allowing a peak pulse power of 500 kWt.
Da Lat is expected to build a new 15MWt reactor in the future.
3. Da Quy (wild sunflower) Theatre
This is a special architectural work of Da Lat, which is located at the Lam Vien Da Lat Square.
4. Crazy House
Covering an area of approximately 1,600 square meters, Hang Nga Guest House, also known as “Crazy House”, is design by Vietnamese architect Dang Viet Nga.
As the intention of the architect is to make a fairy tale house, the “crazy house” resembles a tree with uneven windows, and tunnel-shaped stairways.
Both the exterior and the interior of the guesthouse are created and decorated with twisting organic forms and very few right angles.
The hollow “tree” extends in many directions, rising above to reach the sky of the amazing Da Lat.
Walking along the cave-shape hallways inside the house is not simply a visit but an exhilarating experience-a departure from the norm, wild mushrooms and spider webs popping up on your way is not unusual.
The guesthouse is a spectacular construction with ten themed guest rooms such as the tiger room, the eagle room, the ant room and the kangaroo room with decorations and handcrafted furniture matching the theme.
The guest house is famous among international tourists.
5. Da Lat clay sculpture tunnel
A kilometer long path snaking through a red basaltic soil hill with sculptures carved out of its sides is set to become a popular tourist attraction in Da Lat.
Located near the famous Tuyen Lam Lake, the path embodies the vision of its founder Trinh Ba Dung to tell the history of the city in a uniquely creative way.
Sculptures on the walls of the path purport to tell the story of Da Lat from more than 100 years ago, when the area was wild and teeming with wildlife, when it was sparsely inhabited by the Co Ho ethnic minority.
Various Co Ho myths including the fleeing of the father tortoise and his children while the mother tortoise fights a huge snake are etched into the wall.
The story indicates that the Co Ho were a matriarchal society.
The French colonial days are indicated with sculptures of landmark buildings like the Da Lat College, Da Lat Railway Station, Pasteur Institute and old villas by the Xuan Huong Lake.
The highest sculpture on the walls is 12m tall.
Work on this complex began in 2010 and more than 100 artisans were on the site during its busiest times.
The first work was a 90sq.m house made of soil, furnished with beds, chairs, tables, wardrobes, washing basins and chimneys, which are all made of soil.
The house stands against a mountain and faces the lake.
There is a map of Vietnam on its roof.
The house was recognized as "The First and the Most Unique House Made of Basaltic Soil without Baking" by the Vietnam Record Book Centre in 2013.
The complex won a Green Architecture Award from the Vietnam Architects Association in 2014.
6. The only white flamboyant tree in Vietnam
Da Lat is the home to Vietnam’s only one white flamboyant tree (White Jacaranda).
The tree was brought to Vietnam by Dr.Ha Ngoc Mai in 1998.
The tree is planted in the villa at No.75Phu Dong Thien Vuong Street, Da Lat.
Dr. Mai brought this tree to Vietnam in 1998 from Sydney, Australia.
At that time, an Asian worker at a nursery in Sydney introduced Mai to a violet flamboyant grafted with a mutated white flamboyant tree.
The price for this violet-white tree was $25.
Three years later, the tree began blossoming bunches of white flowers.
The first bunches of white flamboyant yielded several fruits and Dr.Mai cultivated over 50 seedlings from these fruits.
However, they produced violet flowers, not white.
7. Circle Hostel

6 Reasons Why Solo Travel Is So Addictive
Find out why traveling solo is seriously addictive, and no, it isn't just the lower costs when it's all said and done.
The first time you travel solo can be a nerve-wracking experience.
Possibly, for the first time in your life, you only have yourself to rely on.
There’s the little experiences, like not having anyone to look after your bag when you go to the airport bathroom.
Then, there’s the big ones, like finding yourself stranded with nowhere to sleep at midnight, because you’ve been locked out of your hostel.
So why exactly is this so addictive?
Quite simply, because there’s something totally unbeatable about conquering challenges on your own.
About living by the seat of your pants, choosing your own adventures, rules and schedules and being solely accountable for everything that happens.
And that, as all solo travelers know, is the true meaning of freedom.
1. You’ll Learn How To Lead
You’re the director, producer and actor in the movie that is your life, but, in the chaos of everyday moments, this can be hard to remember.
The second you embark on solo travel, you understand the true meaning of being entirely responsible for yourself.
You’re in charge of every decision and there’s nothing more empowering than discovering how capable you are.
2. You’ll Abandon Your Comfort Zones
Traveling solo is always an expansive experience, as it shatters pre-conceived concepts of the world with each step you take into the unknown.
New doors open up at every stop, in a way that’s not always visible when you’re occupied with travel companions.
You’re more inclined to talk to strangers and you’ll notice more people will want to connect with you.
Left to your own devices, you’ll try things you’ve never even considered and your ‘comfort zones’ will soon be a thing of the past.
3. You’ll Get To Reinvent Yourself
At home, you might be the shy one in your group of friends, the one who picks up everyone’s slack, the gardener, the computer whiz or the serious academic.
When you travel solo, no one knows, or cares, about the labels attached to you.
You can become an adventurer, a photographer, a farmer, a diver.
Whatever appeals to you, just take your pick!
You’ll discover things about yourself that haven’t had the space to appear in your busy home life.
The freedom to reinvent yourself and grow, without any input from people you know or past experiences, is seriously addictive in the best possible way.
4. You’ll Learn To Live In The Present Moment
There’s nothing like gazing at an awe-inspiring, foreign landscape on your own and knowing you only have a few, precious moments to soak it in.
You can’t take the landscape home with you and you might not ever return.
Without your friend next to you, chatting your ear off, you become totally immersed in the present moment.
It’s just you and the earth.
Travelling solo gives you the space to truly appreciate each moment, through your eyes alone.
5. You’ll Learn How To Spot Trouble From A Distance
A more attuned ‘trouble radar’ seems to exist for those of us who love to travel on our own.
You have to be more careful about your belongings, about heading out at night and about trusting people.
Because of this, you develop the ability to spot trouble from a distance, before it enters your world.
This is an invaluable skill for future travels and one that’s carried over into your life in general.
6. You’ll Discover What’s Important In Life
“To awaken quite alone in a strange town is one of the pleasantest sensations in the world.” – Freya
You can forget about expectations and even aspirations that take you away from living life, right now, into a future projection of it.
You can enjoy the simple pleasures of savoring exotic food for as long as you want, basking in the curious smile of a local child and letting your mind run free towards the next destination.
When you return home, all those ‘big’ issues will have faded into oblivion under an avalanche of freedom and aliveness.
You’ll view the world with fresh, empowered eyes.
And that’s the ultimate addiction.
Vietnamese spent $6 billion on overseas tours last year
Favorite destinations included Thailand, Cambodia, Japan and South Korea while local attractions became less appealing
Around six million Vietnamese traveled abroad for holiday last year and spent roughly US$6 billion, according to the Vietnam Tourism Association.
That was significant up from $3.5 billion in 2012, the association said, as cited by local media.
According to tour operators, favorite destinations included Thailand, Cambodia, Japan, South Korea, Europe and the US.
Vietnam’s top tourist companies such as Vietravel and Saigontourist said overseas tours have grown faster than domestic tours.
Vietnam itself is home to many famous destinations, including Ha Long Bay, the Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park and Hoi An ancient town, all of which are UNESCO heritage sites.
But poor service quality, high prices and lack of creativity are among the main reasons that local tourists prefer going abroad, experts say.
Meanwhile, many foreign countries such as Japan and South Korea have simplified visa procedures for Vietnamese tourists and offered very competitive tour prices in recent years, they say.
White mountain, Green tourism
The French Alpine town of Chamonix has been a magnet for tourists since the 18th century.
But, today, tourism and climate change are putting pressure on the surrounding environment.
Marc Grainger reports.
The town of Chamonix- Mont-blanc sits in valley at 1,035 metres above sea level in the Haute-Savoie department in south-eastern France.
To the north- west are the red peaks of the Aiguilles Rouges massif; to the south-east are the permanently white peaks of Mont Blanc which at 4,810 metres is the highest mountain in the Alps.
It's a typical Alpine environment, but one that is under increasing strain from the hustle and bustle of human activity
Tourism is Chamonix's lifeblood.
Visitors have been encouraged to visit the valley ever since it was discovered by explorers in 1741.
Over 40 years later, in 1786, Mont Blanc's summit was finally reached by a French doctor and his guide, and this gave birth to the sport of alpinism, with Chamonix at its centre.
In 1924, it hosted the first Winter Olympics, and the cable cars and lifts that were built in the years that followed gave everyone access to the ski slopes.
Today, Chamonix is a modern town, connected to the outside world via the Mont Blanc Road Tunnel and a busy highway network.
It receives up to 60,000 visitors at a time during the silk season, and climbers, hikers and extreme- sports enthusiasts swarm there in the summer in even greater numbers, swelling the town's population to 100,000.
It is the third most visited natural site in the world, according to Chamonix's Tourism Office and, last year, it had 5,2 million visitor bed nights- all this in a town with fewer than 10,000 permanent inhabitants.
The influx of tourists has put the local environment under severe pressure, and the authorities in the valley have decided to take action.
Educating visitors is vital.
Tourists are warned not to drop rubbish, and there are now recycling points dotted all around the valley, from the town centre to halfway up the mountains.
An internet blog reports environmental news in the town, and the “green" message is delivered with all the tourist office's activities.
Low-carbon initiatives are also important for the region.
France is committed to reducing its carbon emissions by a factor of four by 2050.
Central to achieving this aim is a strategy that encourages communities to identify their carbon emissions on a local level and make plans to reduce them.
Studies have identified that accommodation accounts for half of all carbon emissions in the Chamonix valley.
Hotels are known to be inefficient operations, but those around Chamonix are now cleaning up their act.
Some are using low-energy lighting, restricting water use and making recycling bins available for guests; others have invested in huge projects such as furnishing and decorating using locally sourced materials, using geothermal energy for heating and installing solar panels.
Chamonix’s council is encouraging the use of renewable energy in private properties too, by making funds available for green renovations and new constructions.
At the same time, public-sector buildings have also undergone improvements to make them more energy efficient and less wasteful.
For example, the local ice rink has reduced its annual water consumption from 140,000 cubic metres to 10,000 cubic metres in the space of three years.
Improving public transport is another feature of the new policy, as 80 percent of carbon emissions from transport used to come from private vehicles.
While the Mont Blanc Express is an ideal way to travel within the valley- and see some incredible scenery along the route- it is much more difficult to arrive in Chamonix from outside by rail.
There is no direct line from the closest airport in Geneva, so tourists arriving by air normally transfer by car or bus.
However, at a cost of 3.3 million euros year, Chamonix has introduced a free shuttle service in order to get people out of their cars and into buses fitted with particle filters.
If the valley’s visitors and residents want to know why they need to reduce their environmental impact, they just have to look up; the effects of climate change are there for everyone to see in the melting glaciers that cling to the mountains.
The fragility of the Alpine environment has long been a concern among local people.
Today, 70 percent of the 805 square kilometres that comprise Chamonix- Mont-Blanc is protected in some way.
But now, the impact of tourism has led the authorities to recognize that more must be done if the valley is to remain prosperous: that they must not only project the natural environment better, but also manage the numbers of visitors better, so that its residents can happily remain there.
Northern flavors cure homesickness in Saigon
People from Hanoi and Saigon recognize each other as compatriots and share almost everything from their language to their customs, and most certainly their food, despite the 3,000 kilometers that separates them.
Having been in Saigon for more than 20 years, the kiosks at the end of Chu Manh Trinh (District 1), Tran Quoc Toan, Vo Thi Sau and Nguyen Thong Street (District 3) have almost every northern specialty for sale.
Food such as dried bamboo shoots, fragrant mushrooms, arrowroot noodles from Bac Kan and hundreds of specialties all find their way to Saigon, mostly by train.
Food with a short shelf-life like tofu from the famous Mo village in Hanoi, salted pork and hand-ground squid cakes are treated with care and get here by air.
Instant food like the sweet dessert 'che' and sticky rice also secure a seat on the planes that shuttle between the regions.
Hanoi’s square ‘banh chung’ still reigns supreme and takes up the most space.
According to shop owners, despite being brought from the capital, the price here is still not much higher than in Hanoi.
Processed foods such as ground meat cake ‘gio’ and ‘cha’ are also easy to find for northern people living in Saigon.
Not everything sold in these markets is exclusive to the North.
Many shop owners still want their goods to be shipped from their home towns.
Housewives can find all kinds of food that remind them of the scent of Hanoi here like ‘sau’ (dratoncomelon).
Northern style pickles, sauces and pastes are available all year round.
Some shops offer the beer lovers’ favorite snack: ‘banh da’, the thin crunchy crackers riddled with black sesame seeds that has become a part of after-work culture.
Fresh lime leaves, the most important aromatic compliment for the popular boiled chicken, found on every corner in the north but almost nowhere in the south.
Northern fruits are also a good seller.
Everything you need is within reach.
Even if the fruit you are after is not available, a quick phone call will quickly satisfy your craving.

The modest, peaceful village is a popular destination in Hue.
Visitors are charmed by the village’s gardens of centuries-old trees, which have been preserved by the locals as a precious heritage.

Visitors to Phuoc Tich are amazed at its ancient houses.
More than 30 houses in the village are up to a century old.

They are so well preserved as to astonish cultural anthropologists, architects, and historians.
The village’s ancient houses are nha ruong, a kind of residence built with artfully carved wooden pillars and beams.
They are held together with wooden pegs so they can be easily dismantled.
Phuoc Tich houses are made principally of jackfruit wood and are adorned with exquisite carvings, most of which remain undamaged despite having gone through many wars throughout the years.
Most of the ancient houses in the village have large yards full of old trees and separated by rows of tea trees, creating an exotic green space.
Le Trong Dien, the owner of an ancient house in Phuoc Tich, said both the ancient houses and their gardens attract tourists: 
“Phuoc Tich people are hospitable and they want to introduce their houses to others. Phuoc Tich ceramics, trees, and lifestyles are different from elsewhere”.
Visitors are introduced to a unique way of producing ceramic products and may try to work as a ceramic craftsman, just one of the many unforgettable experiences Phuoc Tich provides.
Local people treasure their ceramic making craft and devote a separate area, known as Treng Islet, to preserving ancient ceramic pieces.
They were very expensive and very sought-after.
At that time, our village was rich with many houses.
All children went to school.
Phuoc Tich people began making ceramic products in 1940.
At that time, I was small.
In 1975, I began making ceramic products.
Ruong houses in Phuoc Tich were built with revenues from selling ceramic items”.
Visitors to Phuoc Tich also like the local food specialties, especially the rice cakes made by local women.
Ms Nguyen Thi Thuy, who lives in the village, said local women set up a cooking club to introduce local food to visitors: “Here we serve pickles, pork with shrimp sauce, and a variety of rice cakes.
Our club has 16 members.
By joining the club, local women can earn extra income”.
Tourists to Phuoc Tich often arrange to stay in local houses living with the local people and learning something about their lives.

The State Academic Kuban Cossack Chorus, Russia
The State Academic Kuban Cossack Chorus is the oldest Russian folk chorus, with a history that goes back to 1811.
At that time it was a military choir of the Kuban Cossack Army, based in Ekaterinodar, the capital city of the South Russian province of Kuban, performing mostly in churches during religious services. Later, the Chorus started to give secular stage performances, and its repertoire got broader with classical pieces and folk songs.
For over 200 years now the Chorus has been a symbol and pride of Russian folk art.
The Chorus received highest awards for its great contributions in Russian culture.
It is the only company in Russia that received an honorary title of Ambassador of “SOCHI 2014” Olympics.
The temperament, originality and superior skills of the State Academic Kuban Cossack Chorus have received enthusiastic applauses in many countries as well as much praises from the national and foreign press and prominent figures in arts.

Time Period The scientific inventory was carried out during the following times:
Phase 1: August 25 – September 30, 2010;
Phases 2 and 3: October 5, 2010 – February 30, 2011.
Objectives The scientific inventory had the following objectives:
To survey and assess the situation of the worship of Hùng Kings among Vi?t communities within Phú Thọ province, where the worship of Hùng Kings originated and whence it has been passed on;
To systematically collect data provided by these communities in order to assess the existing situation of material heritage and cultural-religious activities directly related to the Hùng Kings, and draw on these data in planning for the further collection, preservation and promotion of the cultural-heritage values of the worship of Hùng Kings (as it has been carried out on different scales and at different levels for many years);
To collect scientific evidence in accordance with UNESCO’s guidelines and criteria, and later include this evidence in the profile to be submitted to  UNESCO for inscription of the worship of Hùng Kings on the Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
Locations
Characteristics of Residential Areas and the System of Belief Practice and Festivals Related to the Worship of Hùng Kings
The area comprising all the villages/hamlets in which Hùng Kings worship and festivals related to figures of the Hùng Kings period take place is very  large, covering the eastern, northern and western parts of Phú Thọ province (12 out of 13 districts, towns and cities, and 74 out of 275 communes, wards and towns with 109 villages, hamlets and residential quarters); many of these sites can be found in two central areas, consisting of the communes, wards and towns of Vi?t Trì City and Lâm Thao District.
A unique character is worshipped in each of the belief spaces of nearly all the villages in these 12 districts, towns, and cities of Phú Thọ province.
As a  first step, we focus on the worship of Hùng Kings; later other characters will be examined as additional data relevant to determining the scale of worship.
Selection of Villages for the Scientific Inventory The selection of villages for the scientific inventory was made with attention to the following issues:
On the basis of the Hùng Kings Family Tree, legends, conferments and petition sheets currently kept in the vicinity of Hùng Kings temples and shrines in communes of Lâm Thao District, Vi?t Trì City, as well as Sino-Vietnamese documents held by the Institute of Sino Studies, Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences, where titles of Hùng Kings are granted by different feudal dynasties (mostly from the 15th century and later), villages, hamlets and residential quarters worshipping the Hùng Kings are determined by the following criteria:
First, villages, hamlets and residential quarters with worshipping sites dedicated to figures named as Hùng Kings;
Second, villages, hamlets and residential quarters with  worshipping sites dedicated to the Hùng Kings under folk names (nicknames or names used because of certain taboos, etc.) such as ?t S?n Thánh V??ng, Vi?n S?n Thánh V??ng, ??t Ng?t Cao S?n and Cao S?n Thánh V??ng;
Third, villages, hamlets and residential quarters with worshipping sites dedicated to the Hùng Kings following the two above-mentioned criteria which existed before 1945, although they might no longer have worshipping sites or their worshipping sites are now in ruins, are also considered in  the determination of the cultural space of Hùng Kings worship;
Locations where there are worshipping sites under other names (such as ??c Thánh Sa L?c, ??i V??ng Thọ?ng ??ng Thọn, Hi?n Lang ??i V??ng, Hi?n Công ??i V??ng and ?ông H?i ??i V??ng) are also seen as worshipping sites dedicated to the Hùng Kings, and are named in a separate list to be investigated later.
In general, villages, hamlets and residential quarters to be investigated during this inventory are located in a semi-mountainous region where the mountains drop from the southwest (Yên L?p, Thanh S?n, Thanh Thọy, Tam Nông, and C?m Khê districts) to the northeast (Lâm Thao District, Vi?t Trì City, Phù Ninh District, Phú Thọ Town, Thanh Ba, ?oan Hùng, and H? Hòa districts). Around Ngh?a L?nh stand low hills at the centre of the midlands.
Thousands of years ago, this area played a very important economic, social and cultural role, being both the site of the natural development of a community and the site where the Hùng Kings established the capital city of V?n Lang.
One can see that the direction in which the mountains fall – from northwest to southeast – is also the direction in which three major rivers flow – the Thao, the Lô, and the ?à – together contributing to the creation of fertile lands along their banks where communities of farmers developed and at the same time contributing to the formation of the delta.
The main livelihoods of people living within this area have remained almost the same to this day – wet-rice cultivation and animal husbandry.
Archeological evidence collected over the past 50 years shows that people of the ancient cultures of Phùng Nguyên, ??ng ??u, Gò Mun and ?ông S?n built houses, workshops and tombs in this area.
From a geographical-cultural perspective, the Vi?t–M??ng people have a long history.
The society was animistic, worshipping mountain gods, ancestors, tutelary gods and Buddhism.
Historically, Phú Thọ Province lies within the area of settlement and cultural intersection between the countries of V?n Lang and Âu L?c. This area also served as a gate for exchange between the delta area, with the cultures of the northwest, and part of Vi?t B?c (North of Hanoi).
Generations of inhabitants of this area had close political, economic, cultural and social relationships with each other.
The area has a long history of formation  involving   many  important  events related  to  the establishment, development and protection of the country by the ancient Vi?t people together with other ethnic groups.
Research Methods
Research methods included interviews by questionnaire, in-depth interviews, focus-group interviews, recording oral histories, and statistics. The research was carried out in a participatory way with respect for community voices, with one of its aims being preservation of history.
An interdisciplinary research approach (including bibliography, archeology, text studies, and museum studies) was also taken for analysis and comparison of different sources of information and determination of the subject of the investigation and inventory.
Difficulties
Over the long history of the area's development, because of natural geological changes and social and economic changes following different administrative structures, many place names have changed with old  names being replaced by new. Knowledgeable people are few, texts have not been transferred sustainably or systematically to younger generations, many administrative places have shifted or been extended, many belief practices and customs have degraded (especially in the period since 1945), and in many cases contemporary culture has supplanted traditional culture.
Gaps have appeared in the generational transfer of traditional culture because of war and other historical-social conditions.
On field trips to the localities, we noticed that many sites associated with the worship of Hùng Kings (communal halls, temples, Buddhist temples, shrines) had been destroyed or seriously damaged.
There are also cases where temples/communal halls have been moved to new sites for restoration, and re- built with new techniques, forms and materials, and as a result have become religiously unattractive or irrelevant to their communities.
In most of the places investigated, the cultural staff and commune managers are young people who have limited capacities and understandings of  traditional culture, do not understand or cannot meet standard requirements of cultural management, and are incapable of helping local people collect, investigate and preserve their heritage.
As a result, many valuable heritage sites which were destroyed or damaged have not received the necessary attention for development of restoration plans or submission of requests for financial support from the authorities.
Since 1996, most residential areas which in the past were villages and hamlets have been changed into numbered residential quarters (Residential Quarter No.1, No.2, No.3, etc.).
Thus, the traditional names of many villages and hamlets which had existed for thousands years, were rooted deeply in the minds of local people and were closely associated with the characteristics and origins of each village/hamlet as well as many other traditional values have been eliminated.
In addition, several large, densely populated villages/hamlets have also been divided into residential quarters.
Now, only in residential quarters where worshipping sites are situated do local people pay much  attention to or know (at differing levels) about the worship.
In other residential quarters, people are much less attached to the belief, and therefore their awareness and sense of responsibility have faded.
In many villages, sites associated with Hùng Kings worship were destroyed (for different reasons) many decades ago, and the worshipping space in some villages/hamlets has been taken over for use by local authorities or individuals.
Thus, in many places it is almost impossible to restore ancient belief activities – a great  loss to the culture.
The worship of Hùng Kings is a cultural activity originating from a dynasty passed on in legends.
All the figures associated with this ancient period over thousands of years of worship by common people have been molded and transformed according to diverse cultural layers and customs.
herefore, even when they exist in the same worshipping space, sometimes it is very difficult  to name the main worshipped figure.
In many places it is difficult to identify worshipped  figures  because  of  ambiguity  and transformation  (due  to hèm customs or perceptions) as well as replacement of figures (between Hùng Kings and related figures).
Due to the limited time allocated to the inventory and limited number of professional staff, the work of data collection together with the community showed certain shortcomings. These shortcomings partly reflect in the results of the inventory and investigation, especially in the evaluation of typical expressions of the heritage and the system of ancient languages which are closely associated with the traditional festivals in particular and cultural activities of the villages/communes in general.
Advantages
During the time carrying out the inventory, the research group received a great deal of support from local authorities, district/commune cultural staff and village heads who worked to create favorable working conditions for the group.
In particular, almost all the hamlet heads and commune cultural staff participated directly in organizing focus-group interviews in the localities, actively addressing issues raised during the interviews and contributing greatly to the production of results from the interviews.
All the local people (especially the elderly people and members of the festival management board) either directly or indirectly participated  in providing information. They were enthusiastic and formed a consensus in  regard to the preservation, promotion and dissemination of Hùng Kings worship and festivals related to the Hùng Kings in their localities.
Many elderly people provided the research group with valuable documents which individuals had collected, complied or translated and which serve well as references for the questionnaires.
Support from members of the heritage site management board and association of elderly people in villages in organizing and facilitating interviews helped the research group a great deal in ensuring the quality of the inventory.
Investigation–Inventory Results
Given the above-mentioned advantages and surmounted difficulties, the research group achieved certain results.
Documents and information provided  by the focus groups and by the questionnaires confirm the diversity, newness and systematicness of documentation and knowledge of Hùng Kings worship and festivals associated with the Hùng Kings in the past and the present.
Cultural-historical heritage sites were identified in 12 districts, towns and cities (C?m Khê, ?oan Hùng, H? Hòa, Lame Theo, Phù Ninh, Tam Nông, Thanh Ba, Thanh S?n, Thanh Thọy and Yên L?p districts, Phú Thọ Town, and Vi?t Trì City) with 109 villages, hamlets and residential quarters being investigated, among which 46 villages and hamlets (in 29 communes, wards and towns) are home to cultural activities and festivals directly related to Hùng Kings worship, and have worshipping sites under the names of the original Hùng Kings or their 18 generations of descendants.
These villages and hamlets with existing heritage sites directly associated with Hùng Kings worship and festivals are mostly situated in Lâm Thao District and Vi?t Trì City.
The existence of a number of festivals directly associated with the worship of Hùng Kings in several villages and hamlets of C?m Khê District (Kh?ng T??c village), Lam Thao District (the two villages of Tr?o and Vi) and Vi?t Trì City (Hùng Lô village) with significant remnants (ponds, drill grounds of Hùng King troops, places where the Kings stopped to visit local people, places where the Kings celebrated the New Year together with villagers, places where the Kings taught people how to cultivate rice, etc.) and a number of ancient place names have provided important data, contributing to the success of the research on the culture and beliefs of the ancient Vi?t – M??ng people.
Together with the above-mentioned sites, there are also 139 sites in 52 communes (76 villages or hamlets) of 12 districts worshipping Hùng Kings under names such as Cao S?n Thánh V??ng, ??t Ng?t Cao S?n, ?t S?n Thánh V??ng and Vi?n S?n Thánh V??ng.
Specific Results from the Investigation-Inventory
The data obtained from the research contain a great deal of information which can be divided into two main groups: quantitative data (obtained using quantitative research methods such as questionnaires and statistics) and qualitative data (obtained using ethnographical methods and oral history recording, etc.)These data reflect on: a.cultural and belief activities and festivals related to the Hùng Kings which took place in the past; b/ cultural and belief activities and festivals related to the Hùng Kings which take place today; c.chief characteristics of these cultural and belief activities; d.the condition of the tangible culture associated with the belief and festival activities; and, e.issues relating to the preservation and promotion of the cultural values of the belief practices and festivals associated with the Hùng Kings in particular and figures of the Hùng King period in general.
Cultural and Belief Activities and Festivals in the Past
Cultural and Belief Activities Places serving the belief and festival activities were gradually established in all villages and hamlets by local communities over a period of many hundreds of years, in the form of communal halls, temples and shrines, of which communal halls made up more than 90%.
The inventory list shows the dense distribution and establishment of worshipping places related to the worship of Hùng Kings in Phú Thọ Province.
In 46 villages and hamlets having worshipping sites under the direct name of the Hùng Kings there are 43 communal halls, 6 temples and 2 Buddhist temples.
In 76 villages/hamlets having worshipping sites under the names of Cao S?n Minh V??ng, ??t Ng?t Cao S?n, ?t S?n Thánh V??ng or Vi?n S?n Thánh V??ng there are 99 communal halls, 15 temples, 18 shrines, and 7 Buddhist temples.
According to the oral histories obtained from elderly people, in most villages/hamlets, before 1945, the worshipping sites dedicated to the Hùng Kings  in  particular  and  other  figures  in  Phú  Thọ  Province  in general were established  during one  or the  other of two  historical periods.
Before  the  10th century, most of the worshipping sites (communal halls, temples, and shrines) were made of bamboo and with thatched roofs, while some were made in the form of a house on pillars to avoid predators and flooding.
Since the Lý Dynasty, and especially under the Lê Dynasty (the 15th century), with the permission of local authorities and the court, people in Phú Thọ Province (as in many other places) mobilized the community to build big (both in terms of architectural structure and interior) worshipping sites in villages. People also organized large-scale sacred and solemn festivals.
Besides paying attention to the sites through granting conferments and orders, feudal  governments  also gave permission for villages to restore worshipping sites in order to serve the belief activities, considering this a tool of the ruling apparatus  at  different levels.
For the period after 1945, due to the limited knowledge of local authorities, and because of the weather and natural conditions, most worshipping  sites (90%) in Phú Thọ Province were destroyed or ran to ruin.
The most serious destruction occurred in 1956–57, 1961 and 1975.
Only since the 1990s have many of these worshipping sites been restored to serve the needs of  local cultural and belief activities.
Due to economic conditions, most of the restored worshipping sites are smaller in scale and simpler in architecture than their originals.
However, about 20% of the sites in these villages/hamlets have been completely destroyed, for various objective and subjective reasons.
Only since the time of ??i M?i (Renovation) in Vietnam have rural communities had opportunities to improve their economy and enrich their culture by restoring traditional cultural practices.
Having examined the real situation of the worshipping sites and taken into account community opinions, we see that most villages associated with the worship of the Hùng Kings in particular and  cultural and belief activities in general now need higher-level policy and economic support to restore or upgrade the worshipping sites in order to meet the short and long-term needs of the communities.
Worshipping Altars
In practice, it can be seen that of 181 communal halls and 15 Buddhist temples (of which 43 communal halls and 8 Buddhist temples are dedicated to the Hùng Kings) the focus of the altar arrangement is the worshipping tablet and the incense bowls.
At some worshipping sites, there is also an additional altar for all gods.
In general, the worshipping altars of the Hùng Kings are made in the form of ancestral altars like those which stand in the houses of most Vietnamese families.
Taking Ngh?a L?nh Mountain as the center of Hùng Kings worship, the farther worshipping sites are from this center, the simpler their arrangements; they are not as complicated as the worshipping sites built by feudal regimes at the end of the Post-Lê Dynasty or during the Nguy?n  Dynasty.
Offerings
Offerings prepared for the rituals (rituals of opening the communal halls/temple gates, processions, rituals of closing the communal halls/temple gates) in most localities are quite similar to one another. They include xôi (cooked sticky rice), o?n (cake from cooked sticky rice), fruits, flowers, wine, votive papers, salt, boiled chickens (ideally large, handsome roosters), raw pork (ideally from a black pig), ch?ng cake and dày cake (offered by people of Lâm Thao District and Vi?t Trì City).
n addition, some villages (?ào Xá village in Thanh Thọy District, B?n ?á village in C?m Khê District) include carp in their offerings.
In Tr?o and Vi villages (Lâm Thao District) and Hùng Lô village (Vi?t Trì City), people give whole pigs (ideally black pigs), usually already killed and cleaned, along with some of their bristles and blood, as offerings.
Some villages/hamlets of H? Hòa, ?oan Hùng, and Yên L?p districts require that among the offerings there should be meat from a black buffalo.
It is stipulated in village conventions that all participants in the preparation of offerings – for example, in the selection of roosters, pigs, leaves for the cakes, etc. should be carefully chosen. All the steps in making the cakes, killing the roosters or the pigs, etc. should also be taken very carefully.
For offerings made from meat (black pigs, roosters, buffalos, etc.), strict rules apply to all steps. For example, families chosen to raise the pigs should be happy, well-off, respected by other villagers and not in mourning; the pigs should be kept in open, clean pigsties; containers for their food should be clean and new (the families should buy new bowls and make new pigsties); their food should be clean and  delicious.
In some villages, two or three families are chosen to raise the  animals. When the day of the festival draws near, the entire village will select the best of several animals for the offerings.
When the pigs are killed, the blood should be red; if the blood is not bright red, it is considered bad luck.
When the rooster is killed and cleaned, its skin should not be torn. The rooster must not be put into boiling water, but hung on a stick above the pot, and people must pour boiling water over it until it is cooked.
In regard to fruits, in the past, villagers chose those without pips, and they could pick them only in the land where they had settled down and lived. They were not allowed to take fruits from other places.
Villagers believe that if these unwritten rules were violated, people would have bad luck, their livestock would fall sick, their crops would fail, etc.
In addition to offerings common to all villages/hamlets worshipping  the Hùng Kings, unique features of offerings prepared by certain villages may also be observed.
For example, in the offerings prepared by C? Tích village (Hy C??ng commune, Vi?t Trì City), three branches of young rice are laid on the offering tray together with cooked sticky rice and boiled rooster, and a wish for good weather and good crops is made.
In the rituals of Vi and Tr?o villages of Hùng S?n Town, Lâm Thao District, among the usual offerings there must be a votive black elephant and two horses (one pink and the other white). These animals are made of bamboo, covered with paper and life-size.
A small bamboo stick is tied to a side of each of these animals to serve as a pot where incense sticks can be kept until the last day of the festival when they are burned.
It is believed that these animals serve as means of transport for the Hùng Kings and the gods so that they can go to people facing difficulties such as strong winds, flood, disease, etc.
(See also Bùi Quang Thanh, “Offerings to Hùng Kings”. Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences, 6 (146) – 2011).
Selection of the Ritual Heads
In the past, the ritual head for each festival was also selected very carefully.
In feudal times (before 1945), ritual heads were selected by local authorities.
Later, this position usually came to be determined by village elders and representatives of village clans.
A person selected to be a ritual head should meet the following criteria: male, over 50 years old, with sound knowledge of the ritual procedures, trusted and respected by his community, and not in the mourning period.
When a person has been selected to be the ritual head, he should observe certain unwritten rules such as avoiding participation in  funerals, avoiding hard work and avoiding sexual intercourse to keep his body clean.
He must practice the ritual gestures regularly so that when the  time comes he can perform them gracefully and in conformity with the ritual group. If he makes a mistake, he will be punished by his village.
The ritual head from the year before is responsible for instructing him during his practice period.
In addition, the person selected to be the ritual head should be able to afford the organization of the festival, from inviting different troupes (chèo plays, ca trù singing, and xoan singing, etc.) to inviting his relatives to the festival, from the day of opening to the day of closing.
For the ritual group (??i t?) the criteria are less strict. Ritual group members must be middle-aged, respected by the community and not in the mourning period.
The ritual head manages the operation of the ritual group. People who know the ritual procedures well (usually from the ritual group of the year before) also help coach the ritual group for a time.
The Traditional Festivals
According to the oral histories of elders in all 196  villages/hamlets, before 1945 villages held the festivals each year on differing scales, depending on economic and social conditions and specific village customs.
In the past, two types of festivals took place every year:
The inter-canton festival (the festival jointly organized by several villages in a canton or jointly organized by villages in a customary friendship relationship, worshipping the same communal god);
The festival held in each village/hamlet at a different time (in this case, the people of village divisions (giáp) played a vital role).
Most of the festivals took place in the first lunar month or in the eighth and ninth lunar months.
The organizer of the festivals: As stipulated by the feudal authorities, before 1945 the Committee of Mandarins at canton level directly organized and managed festivals in which the main worshipped figures had been recognized and given conferment by the court.
In regard to village festivals, various giáp in the villages cooperated in organizing the festivals, with each giáp taking responsibility for specific tasks assigned by the Committee of Village Elders.
Funds for festival organization came from two sources: proceeds from fields given to the temple (by local authority or by the court), and donations by men of different giáp participating in the festivals.
Festival procedure: Most focus-group interviews came to the conclusion that festival procedure in individual villages in particular and throughout Phú Thọ Province in general was very complicated and diverse.
Currently there are no written texts (epitaphs, legends, village customary laws, etc.) in any villages/hamlets stipulating festival procedure.
Today festivals are organized according to procedures passed down from earlier generations.
However, certain procedural elements are common throughout the province.
In  most cases, the procession goes from the shrine to the communal hall or temple; or goes from the communal hall or temple around the village and returns to the starting point.
The order of the procession groups is also consistent from village to village: The group of the dancing dragon comes first, then the group carrying the gods’ flags, then the palanquin, eight musical instruments, two rows of eighttreasures and weapons, the incense palanquin, the chair and tablet palanquin, the ritual group, and finally the villagers.
Belief activities and folk games
In almost all the sacred spaces of Hùng Kings worship, local communities organize various cultural activities in which unique symbols representing specific characteristics of habitation, aesthetic style, and perceptions of nature and society are displayed.
These activities include:Belief activities associated with fertility rites, in which symbols of linga and yoni are worshipped and acts of sexual intercourse are mimicked in a game named tùng rí; Belief activities associated with wet-rice cultivation, in which water from the middle of a river is brought to the temple to serve as a worship object, and young rice plants are also placed on the altar; Belief activities in which the career and merits of the worshipped person are enacted: the gestures of the King when he taught people how to cultivate rice and hunt; the gestures of the Princess when she taught people how to raise silkworms and weave fabric.
Belief activities associated with the explanation of certain phenomena in nature and society: why people howl to call/find each other at night when lost in the forest; how the King taught people to make blood pudding when killing pigs.
Belief activities associated with unique inventions from the earliest days of the country’s establishment: how the King taught people how to broil meat after a hunt, perform martial arts, use the bow and arrow, and establish villages close to one another so that they could help and protect one another.
In most regions, especially in isolated villages, people perform similar prayer rituals, such as praying for wealth, for favorable weather, for peace, for a son, etc. in their worship of the Hùng Kings.
In addition to rituals and belief activities performed in the sacred space of the worship of Hùng Kings and other related characters, folk games associated with national memories and the community’s perceptions of everyday life's realities and aesthetic ideals are played by participants of various ages.
Some of these folk games are popular and common to all villages (such as blind-man’s-buff, tug of war, flag catching, swimming competition, and catching ducks in pond or river), and some are unique and specific to certain villages in Phú Thọ Province (such as pig encirclement, trò trám, a fertility game, c??p ph?t, a game of competing to catch a ball, tùng rí, etc.).
Belief Practice and Festivals in Contemporary Society
From the time of the August Revolution of 1945 until the end of the 20th century, for different reasons and because of different historical circumstances, most of the places serving belief practices such as temples, communal halls and shrines were destroyed or badly damaged, and folk festivals were not organized.
In most villages, people quietly prepared offerings and burnt incense to worship the Hùng Kings in particular and other related characters in general at home or in their family worshipping halls.
Thus, serious damage was done to these communities' tangible and intangible culture.
A great number of valuable cultural heritages have been lost, ruined or forgotten.
Gaps in the passing on of traditional culture between generations have had negative impacts on Hùng Kings worshipping communities' social and cultural life.
From the late 1980s on, particularly from 1995 until today, in the many villages in 12 districts worshipping the Hùng Kings in Phú Thọ Province, 50% of sites have been restored (after 1990), 10% have been repaired, 20% are in danger of becoming ruins, and 20% have already become ruins.
Before 1945, most villages worshipping the Hùng Kings regularly organized traditional festivals at different levels.
After nearly half a century  of interruption, from the late 1980s on, these traditional festivals have been restored. The belief and its associated cultural organizations have  been permitted to operate again.
In villages, the elderly (50 years and older) have played an important role in restoring and directly participating in festivals.
Funds for festival organization are mainly donated by local people.
Differences between Today's Festivals and Festivals in the Past
The duration of festivals today is much shorter than in the past (now they mainly take place over one or two days).
The processes of task assignment, budget management and organization of the festival are now discussed openly, and local people can share their opinions on all relevant matters.
All people of villages/hamlets where there are festivals have equal opportunity to participate in the annual or main festival (in accordance with regulations prescribed by festival management boards or local authorities), from contributing human resources to receiving material and moral benefits from the festival.
The festival is organized by the site management board which manages communal halls/ temples under the direct control of the local authority.
Funds for festival organization are partly given by the local authority if possible. However, in most cases, they are donated by the community. Common temple land from which benefits may be saved for festival organization as they were under feudal society no longer exists.
Because of issues of public security and changes in belief and other cultural practices, festivals now are not as boisterous as in the past. Ritual forms and offerings have also been simplified and the meanings of the worship objects have also been lost to some extent.
The process of preparation of offerings has been made simpler; complicated details relating to selection and arrangement of offerings as practiced in the past are now foregone.
Certain parts of the ritual ceremony which are too complicated or long have been removed or shortened.
Belief activities with mysterious meanings and amulets are not practiced anymore.
Further, certain cultural activities with fertility-related meanings have not been restored.
All members of local communities participate in “luck food” feasts, and all are equal in festival activities.
During the processes of preparation and organization of the festival, the community and the local authority coordinate closely with each other to ensure security and legal issues are dealt with following guidelines from the local authority.
Main Features of the Worship of Hùng Kings in Phú Thọ
Most Hùng Kings worshipping villages perform rituals associated with different annual festivals: Lunar New Year, First Full Moon, the festival of ploughing, the festival of harvest, etc.
Perhaps the most remarkable of these is the ritual praying for favorable weather, and good luck in business, life and health.
Offerings are very important. They are carefully selected and include at least three things – a rooster, a black pig and fruits.
To a certain extent, ancient elements associated with the worship of the Hùng Kings remain, expressing themselves in festival performances and folk games associated with ancient legends.
The festival is diverse in form and sacred in content and belief practice, displaying people’s profound awareness of their origins and their history of establishing and protecting the country.
Roles played in the festival are strictly controlled, requiring actors to be strong both in body and in mind.
The System of Cultural Heritage Sites associated with Hùng Kings Worship:
Tangible cultural heritage in villages: The inventory shows that most worshipping sites which are a hundred years old or older have been destroyed. The few which remain are in very bad condition.
Most of the common land which in the past belonged to the worshipping sites has been encroached upon (for example in villages of Đoan Hùng, Hạ Hòa and Yên Lập districts).
The surrounding facilities have also been destroyed, changed or used for other purposes, etc.
Many heritage sites have not received proper attention from cultural management boards.
Some sites have been encroached upon or used for non- belief purposes.
According to the statistics of the local authority, at present, in 46 villages/hamlets directly practicing the worship of Hùng Kings, 80% of the ponds associated with this belief have been either filled up or narrowed to serve different purposes.
any ponds, shrines and temples associated with heritage sites have disappeared: e.g. he place believed to be the drill ground during the time of the Hùng Kings in Tiên Kiên commune (Lâm Thao), Đạng communal hall in Xuân Viên commune (Yên Lập), Đanh communal hall in Chính Công commnune, Tân Tiến communal hall in Vĩnh Chân commune (Hạ Hòa). Some sites which in the past were spacious worshipping sites have been destroyed, and currently there are no fund for their restoration (e.g.Cả communal hall in Hùng Sơn town, Lâm Thao district; the cluster of sites in Đanh hamlet, Chính Công commune, Hạ Hòa).
Of the sites that have been restored in the last decade by local communities, none can be compared with its original in terms of scale and architecture.
In most of these new sites, the interior of the worshipping space is still simple and does not meet traditional requirements of worship.
The system of intangible cultural heritage in villages/hamlets: So far, most of the villages/hamlets in Phú Thọ Province which have sites associated with Hùng Kings worship do not keep documents of legends, festival information, folk games or activities related to this belief.
In some villages, elderly people try to keep records and translate the legends  and parallel sentences which have  been recorded at local heritage sites. However, this source of information has yet to be properly drawn on.
At some sites, there are collections of books in Sino-Vietnamese which have not yet been translated into modern Vietnamese, so that a great deal of information about traditional culture is still unknown and inaccessible to younger generations of local people.
Passing on Heritage between Generations: Those with the best knowledge of the procedures and contents of festivals are the elderly people who have directly participated in past festivals and performances.
The number of these people is small; however, some of them are now members of festival management boards and heritage site management boards in villages/hamlets.
The largest group of people participating in the rituals is made up of middle-aged men, aged 50 and older.
For certain festival activities, the largest group is made up of young people, aged from 15 to 25.
In the inventory questionnaires, 100% of respondents confirmed that younger generations – children of families living in the villages – are enthusiastic and eager to participate in certain festival activities, but are not eager to carry out ritual practices.
Interviews with children participating in the festival “Procession of the Kings to the village for Tết” (Hùng Sơn town) and “Meeting the Kings for the spring in villages” (Tiên Kiên commune) at the end of 2010 and beginning of 2011, indicated that all were proud to have been selected and eager to participate in the festivals without being paid, given that they are allowed to by their families and schools.
However, because of modern social circumstances and time restrictions, not all young people actively look  for information about their nation’s origins or the aspects of their culture preserved and performed in local festivals.
Most of the legends, copies of the Kings’ family tree, epitaphs and other sources of information in Sino-Vietnamese which are kept in villages have not yet been translated or disseminated, nor have most of the parallel sentences and words inscribed on horizontal lacquered boards in communal halls, temples and Buddhist temples, or the many books in Sino-Vietnamese.
Issues Relating to the Preservation and Promotion of Heritage Values
The Situation and Positive Impact of the Heritage
Most of the belief and cultural activities associated with the worship of Hùng Kings (under different names) in 12 districts/town/cities of Phú Thọ Province have	already	received attention from	local communities, and worshipping sites and festivals have been restored.
However, economic difficulties together with other objective and subjective circumstances have meant that the number of restored sites is still small.
Examples can be given in poor districts such as Hạ Hòa, Thanh Ba, Yên Lập, and Thanh Sơn.
Also, because the belief practice was prohibited and therefore did not receive any attention from local authorities or local people for half a century, many sites have been encroached upon to differing degrees.
Many of the objects used at rituals or for interior decoration are broken.
Meanwhile, communities need  ritual practice.
In most localities, costs for the restoration of worshipping sites have been covered by communities.
Examples can be given in Cẩm Khê and Phù Ninh districts and Việt Trì City.
Among villagers today, middle-aged people show the highest level of awareness of the necessity of heritage preservation, as evidenced by their contributions to preservation projects.
If in the second half of the 20th century elderly people were the largest group practicing Hùng Kings  worship,  then since the 1990s more and more young people have been participating in worshipping activities, both male and female.
Particularly in localities with many traditional festivals such as Cẩm Khê, Lâm Thao, Thanh Thuỷ, and Phù Ninh districts and Việt Trì City, people of widely different groups and backgrounds participate in festivals.
In the last ten years, several localities have restored festival activities worshipping the Hùng Kings (Đào Xá commune in Thanh Thuỷ district, Hùng Lô commune in Việt Trì City, Khổng Tước commune in Cẩm Khê district, Vi and Trẹo villages in Hùng Sơn town and villages in Tiên Kiên commune, Lâm Thao district, etc.), thus helping younger generations understand and learn more about traditional values, their nation’s history, and preservation of traditional values.
The survey of villages where festivals worshipping Hùng Kings are held in particular and village festivals in general shows that local authorities and cultural  management  boards  at  different  levels  (but  especially  at commune level) have directly participated in and taken responsibility for organizing, managing and monitoring all steps of the festivals, and that in this respect local people are satisfied with local authorities at commune and village level.
This is also evidence of the consensus which has created sustainable conditions for the preservation of the festivals, bringing a positive influence upon the exploitation of the festivals’ values and meanings.
As a first step, the local authority has co-operated with the community in accordance with the principles of socialization in management in order to preserve and exploit the heritage site’s values, and restore the heritage sites as required in each specific case, meeting the community’s needs in belief  practice.
90% of survey respondents agreed with the work done by the local authority during restoration and preservation of festivals associated with the worship of Hùng Kings.
Possible Risks for the Heritage Sites:
95% of survey discussion participants saw weaknesses and limitations in various aspects of the heritage preservation: namely, in collection of related information, and in historical recording of the worship and procedures of local traditional festivals. The number of people who know Sino-Vietnamese has decreased significantly; in some localities today, no one knows this language.
Most of the knowledge of festival procedures, content, activities and performance (palanquin procession, folk games, etc.) has only been passed on orally.
Some elderly people have been trying to record this kind of information. Mainly, however, they do it spontaneously and subjectively. The information recorded has not been discussed carefully and has not been disseminated widely in the community.
This has led to the gradual loss of this source of intangible cultural heritage which was invented and practiced in the past and to loss of the unique local identity associated with it.
100% of discussion participants regarded the local authority’s weakness at various levels in managing the processes of information collection, recording and disseminating relevant information to members of the community as one of the causes of the loss of heritage site values.
90% of discussion participants believed that the local authority was not active enough or creative enough in widening its network and mobilizing resources in society for the preservation and exploitation of cultural heritage in the locality.
100% of discussion participants suggested that the local authority should improve its capacity in management so that the Law on Cultural Heritage could be implemented in practice and made to meet the needs of cultural heritage preservation in each village/hamlet.
As stated by some representatives of village heritage management boards, one of the reasons that heritage sites had been neglected and their ecological- human environment negatively affected was that the people tasked with taking care of the sites (temple guards, ritual heads, members of the heritage management boards, etc.) were not paid for their service.
Cultural management at various levels focuses largely on drawing up and disseminating  administrative guidelines and organizing activities to disseminate government policies. Cultural management workers are not proactive in making long-term plans for the preservation and exploitation of cultural heritage values in the localities.
Most of the cultural management staff working for the Department of Culture and Information at district level or commune/ward level are young people with limited knowledge of local traditional culture.
Therefore, their management is not effective and cannot meet the community’s needs in preservation and exploitation of cultural heritage.
In practice, coordination between schools and the community in the preservation of cultural heritage in villages is weak.
The relevant propaganda does not seem to be very effective.
In the Year 6 Textbook on Linguistics and Culture, the section introducing legends and traditional festivals associated with the period of Hùng Kings and the nation’s origin is quite short.
In some places, the local authority and the community disagree on the values of their cultural heritage.
For example, in Xuân Viên commune, Yên Lập district, the local authority currently is withholding approval of the restoration of worship places which had existed in the past but were destroyed in the 1970s, arguing that it does so to fight superstition.
The community is willing to contribute money to restore these heritage sites which in the past were part of the grand procession in the commune’s traditional festival. However, the local authority has not given its approval for the restoration, and so the people of Xuân Viên commune must practice their belief in the neighboring commune.
Property violation and encroachment occurs at many sites of Hùng Kings worship, due to either bad land use management or bad cultural management, illegally or with the permission of the local authority.
in addition, the local authority in some places also allows people to destroy heritage sites to use the land for other purposes.
Most discussion participants suggested that the authorities at various levels should pay more attention to groups of successful local businessmen who wish to fund the restoration of their local cultural heritage.

Bach Hac or White Crane is a name that has long been used.
It is written in Linh Nam Chich Quai (a Collection of Strange Stories in Linh Nam) that: "there was in the ancient Phong Chau a big wide shade tree called Chien Dan on which white cranes built their nests, thus this area is named Bach Hac or White Crane": The region of Bach Hac Confluence is where three big rivers namely Thao, Da and Lo meet each other.
Located in a convenient position, Bach Hac was a great place of residence for the ancient Vietnamese people, since it had mountains, hills and plains. When the area was flooded,they moved to hills and mountains to make a living there and if the weather was good, they spead to the plains to cultivate rice.
Moreover, this area was chosen by Hung Kings for the establishment and construction of Van Lang State.
On this area still exist various legends of the time when Hung Kings founded Van Lang state such as the story of Heaven God (whose heel is still seen engraved on a stone on the edge of Bach Hac river) giving names to 100 children of Lac Long Quan, the legends of the fight between Son Tinh and Thuy Tinh, and of two brothers named Tho Lenh and Thach Khanh.
Bach Hac is also a place of various historical and cultural relics such as Tam Giang Pagoda, Bach Hac Communal House, Lang Dai Temple, Ha Than Shrine. Coming to Bach Hac, visitors can have a chance to enjoy a number of important festivals and events such as Bach Hac Regetta Festival, Glutinuous Rice Dumpling Contest, Wrestling Competition, etc. The name of each commune and village in Bach Hac is associated with one legend of Hung Kings time.
The land of Bach Hac Confluence has long been well-known for its charming waterways and liveliness. In the afternoon, the flaming sun sets down to Ba Vi Range amid the happy folksongs sung by fishermen who are catching fish in the river.
All these make Bach Hac a land of picturesque landscapes with its unique and distinct tangible and intangible cultural heritages an appealing point of arrival for visitors who come here to be fully satisfied.

Cottages with palm-leaf roof, conical peaked hats and raincoats made from the leaves of palm trees have long protected generations of Vietnamese people from hard weather conditions.
At present, Phu Tho provides major source of this material for the production of handicrafts and, more importantly is an ideal destination for those who come here on eco-tours, for relaxation and entertainment.

The province each year exports 10,000 tones of dried tender tea.
Those who have been to Phu Tho’s midland areas of Doan Hung, Thanh Ba, Ha Hoa, Cam Khe, Phu Ninh, etc. would never forget their green tea hills which look like layers of glutinous rice trays, featuring magnificent natural landscape.
Midland girls are very skillful in picking tender tea leaves smiling happily and singing folksongs, which reflects the tranquil life of a rural area.
It would be great to take sips of strong green tea which is a little bit bitter at first, but then leave a long lasting sweet after taste. It is difficult to tell the feeling of drinking the tea from the teapot of weather-beaten farmers in the tea area who will tell us many stories about the tea tree and legends of the national building era. It would also be very wonderful to enjoy a bowl of green tea by the elderly here avoiding the extreme heat of summer days.

Being situated in Lang Ca, Tho Son commune, Viet Tri city, Phu Tho province, and had been discovered in 1959, the relics has been nationally recognized.
Archeological findings have revealed that this used to be the habitat, and then the burial site of old Viet people in Hung Kings' time.
The relics dated from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD.

Go De archaeological relics containing of diverse tools, conveying the development of ancient Viet indigenous civilizations of Van Lang State.
Boasting a long history, Phu Tho is renowned as the cradle of Vietnam civilization; thus, Phu Tho people have been restoring and developing traditions and typical features of Vietnamese people.
The people here are famous for their creativeness, their perseverance in struggling, their kind-heartedness and artistic souls.
Craft villages of Phu Tho province are illuminating evidence for the observation.
Phu Tho's small industrial and handicrafts production have taken pride in their long history of development.
Perhaps, the traditional handicrafts are not highly efficient but these indigenous products create a considerably typical image for Phu Tho people.
Along the national highway numbered 32 by Hong riven tourists would arrive at Phu Lac, a mountainous village of Cam Khe district, Phu Tho provice.
It is a great chance to sink in a unique world of traditional bamboo charcoal handicrafts, ranging from sophisticated glasses, natural vases, and lovely coffee spoons to delicate blinds, and fragrant orchid baskets.
Bamboo charcoal with artistic beauty has become invaluable for filtering water and deodorizing, which are of great benefits for human health and the environment.
Bamboo charcoal products are of popularity among consumers in developed countries including Japan, South Korea, and China as they are capable of absorbing the harmful substance in the air and in water.
Bamboo charcoal is made from burning bamboo trees, with great care and lots of skills because the ending products may be burnt over into ash or otherwise into coal during a shorter period than required.
Temperature needs to be adjusted to harden and widen the surface of charcoal like iron.
However hard the job sounds, charcoal production of Phu Lac (Cam Khe) enjoys its prestige on the market share as a results of its superior quality.
Although it is not as hectic as other traditional craft villages in Hong River delta region.
Do Xuyen has become a traditional craft village with unique products and its distinctive quietness.
The origin of the village’s bamboo weaving occupation is not acknowledged, though, one cannot deny that it has helped Do Xuyen people survive from a variety of flooding seasons and become an important part-time job for villagers.
The villages products are very simple and hardly needs any investment but skillful hands. The low-profit production has to some certain extent presented the prestige villagers' culture and life in the competitiveness of market mechanism.
The major manufactured goods of Do Xuyen village is bamboo fiberboard for construction with various designs, meeting customers' needs: ceiling fiberboard, measuring 1 meter x 3 meters, or 1 meter x 4 meters, or bamboo containers of varied sizes and reasonable prices.
Do Xuyen can be named as a Bamboo mat village because its bamboo products are widely sold and have created financial resources for villagers.
Furthermore, another typical product is Mam Chap still in existence in spite of the market mechanism.
Nowadays, the occupation of chap bamboo production has witnessed great development up to now, thanks to the investment by Hon Ngoc Vien Dong Ltd., Company the products of Do Xuyen village including bamboo dishes, bowls, and chopsticks have been exported to foreign markets, which is of an immense support for Do Xuyen people to restore the traditional occupation and improve their life.
Being famous nationwide as the home of palm trees, Phu Tho has inevitably develops the conical hat occupation, which is of small-scale, though.
Unlike conical hats of Chuong village in Ha Tay province, Phu Tho conical hats’ most recognizable feature is their simplicity harmonious lines, durableness and reasonable price.
A wide range of villages in Phu Tho are involved in hat production occupation; among them, there arise some prominent ones including Son Nga, Sai Nga, Thanh Nga, Dong Phu and Phu Khe.
The oldest craft village is Son Nga; however; its production of cone hats has now diminished as a result of their low cost-effectiveness.
Sai Nga is comparatively the biggest conical hat producers in the region in recent decades. The village has become a large workshop bustling all day with manufacturing processes of leaf cutting, ironing, designing and hat sewing.
A good hat is defined as the one with beautiful and even sewing lines and smooth surface.
Interestingly the most beautiful one has a verse of romantic poem, or a picture placed in between two layers of thin leaves.
Have you ever stopped in a small shop in roadside to sip a cup of tea on a freezing winter day and noticed the use of a handicraft product of Viet Nam countryside to keep warm for the cup of tea?
It is U Am - traditional teapot warm keeper, which may be considered as the product only for nostalgic people. In modern life, there are many electrical appliances but the teapot warm keeper have been conventionally used in many Vietnamese families and become a favorite souvenir for foreign tourists.
Son Vy a small village of Lam Thao district, Phu Tho province is native land of the unique product.
The occupation of producing teapot warm keepers has expanded in Son Vy Village for more than 100 years, despite of ups and downs in social development.
Villagers have skillfully and artistically created the teapot warm keeper with an exceptional design.
Each teapot warm keeper has turned out to be a familiar utensil of each family throughout the year.
Son Vy’teapot warm keeper was awarded silver medal in the National Handicrafts And Fine Arts Products Fair.
If more efforts are invested in improving its decoration and design, the cost effectiveness of Son Vy teapot warm keepers will be considerably increased, which are a considerable stimulation for the development of traditional craft village.
Doan Ket Hamlet of Hung Lo commune, Phu Ninh district has been well-known for processing vermicelli, rice noodle and rice sheets for hundreds of years.
The hamlet's products have established their brand name and won customers’ trust with their high quality.
For years, the craft village has been in humble and tenacious existence, surprising visitors with the bustling working environment of grinding workshops and many generations of Hung Lo people have grown up with the occupation.
Production of glass noodle and rice noodle hardly requires huge investment so any family can run the business.
Machinery has now replaced the manual manufacturing process, which was in use for decades. A household can now produce 200-300 kilograms per day, helping Hung Lo commune to supply dozens of tons of dried foods such as vermicelli, noodle and rice paper and to market on a daily basis.
Minh Duc Carpentry Village is located in Thanh Uyen commune of Tam Nong district, Phu Tho provice.
The foremost products of the village are commonly-known furniture of beds, cupboards, wardrobes.
Despite of their unpretentious appearance and design, the products have enjoyed popularity because of high quality which satisfy customers’ needs. However; that does not necessarily mean Minh Duc carpentry is without typical splendor.
The origins of carpentry occupation in the village are not known, though; it has become the major of all villagers, earning an annual income of tens of billions of VNDs.
Minh Duc wooden products have widespread to every corner of the nation from rural to urban areas, though, not every user knows its origin.
Placing the trade mark on each product has been all villagers’ desire.
One interesting way to reach a new land and new culture is to enjoy foods there.
The idea is always right because gastronomy is cultural characteristics of each region.
Phu Tho, the ancestor’s land, will serve friends and guests from every corner of country with its special-but- popular dishes.
Lang: habitat living is wide, deep and strong current rivers.
The fishes live in the bed of the river and their food is small animals.
They only appear on the water surface when they are grown-up so fishermen can catch big fish of few kilos to dozens of kilos.
Lang fish is the best tasty catfish.
In the three rivers junction of Viet Tri, there is Anh Vu fish which is considered the rarest river fish.
Anh Vu fish also live in river bed eating mosses on stones. They shelter in caves during the summer time and go out in autumn and winter seasons.
So Anh Vu fish can be caught only in chilled and misty days.
In the feudal period, Anh Vu fish were dedicated to kings only.
Chay fish live in a section of Thao River of Thanh Ba district.
The fish has two delicious spawns.
Connoisseurs don’t hesitate to choose Chay fish for their meals.
In recent years, in Viet Tri city there have been some restaurants serving these fishes.
The most well-known and well- established one is Quan Ca Bo Song (Riverside Fish Restaurant) and following by Quan Ca Bach Hac (Bach Hac Fish Restaurant) and some others.
In recent years, Banh Tai (Tai Cake), a special snack of Phu Tho town ship has regained its reputation. Tai Cake is used in wedding and parties as substituting rice.
Tai Cake has been presented and become a nosh of people of Hanoi and many regions nationwide.
The cake cannot last longer than a day, therefore it requires great care.
Phu Tho Tai Cake has been made by Phu Tho village for long time and called Hon Cake.
The cake is shaped like an ear made from rice powder filled with pork. In fact, the recipe and tools are not too complicated but not everyone can succeed.
Like in the old tome, choosing what rice for making cake is a decisive factor to the taste of the cake. Rice must be soft and glutinous.
After being rinsed, rice is soaked into cold water for a period ranging from two hours to half of a day.
Then rice is ground into powder and made into pieces, which requires the cake makers to use his, or her strength to ensure absolute mixture After that, the powder pieces will be ground in a mortar, and modeled with hand (without any mould).
Skillful people can ensure cakes of same shape, like a thin ear, with pork in the middle.
In the next stage, cake are steamed for 30-60 minutes.
During the process, it is recommended not to make the powder curdle.
Tai Cake is the most delicious on being served hot.
Eating Tai Cake we cannot us spoon or folk but just by hands or a piece of banana leaf. It is the best way you can enjoy the taste of cake completely. It is well blended among glutinous, sweet taste and good smell.
Also being cooked into the 7 dishes like other regions, but Viet Tri Dog Meat has its own taste thanks to professional cooking.
Choosing the meat ingredient plays an important part, omitting the use of commercial fed dogs; dogs raised by mountainous minority people are favorable. Preparing process and using spices are secrets handed over generation to generation within family.
After enjoying dishes, I just can describe as follows: the meat is soft, color is nice. Sausages and grilled meat have good smell and soft.
And dish of steamed dog legs has unfor-gettable taste and smell.
Last dish o stewed bones with green papaya is really a specialty of the midland region.
Viet Tri’ people take pride in their popular gastronomy. And I am sure that if you once visit Viet Tri you would be offered the delicious and special dishes.
Doan Ket Road is considered a center of Viet Tri Dog Meat with about 20 restaurants serving the dishes.
The restaurants have existed for many years but still in simple decoration. The restaurant owners here confirm that well-decorated compartments and well-designed tables are unsuitable for enjoying Viet Tri Dog Meat dishes.
Melientha suavis has been listed in Vietnam Red Book, and the most valuable vegetables among 300 edible ones in Xuan Son National Park.
Having favourable conditions of altitude, humidity and soil, Xuan Son National Park enjoys the biggest number of natural grown melientha suavis in Vietnam.
Melientha suavis is not only important in ecological diversity but also a delicious vegetable for human beings.
The top, leaves, flowers can be cooked in soup, while ripe fruits is edible.
The plants have economic values, medical usages, and also environment significance, because they can last hundreds of years, playing an essential role in reforestation procedure of the National Park.
Melientha suavis can be grown from seeds, or roots and introduced between and among reforested plants or spread between fruiting plants.
The plant is now scattered among other fruiting trees in Xuan Son National Park and neighboring villages.
It is known that the all three regions of Vietnam share a common feature, i.e. possessing delicious grapefruit breeds.
Phuc Trach Pomelo is a specialty of sunny and windy Central region, while Nam Roi Pomelo is grown in fertilize land of South region, and Doan Hung pomelo planted in Doan Hung district of Phu Tho province is quintessence of midland area.
Doan Hung Pomelo also called "Phu Doan Pomelo" is well known with its special characteristics of small size; juiciness, sweet and soft taste and thin skin.
Today Doan Hung district boasts more pomelo breeds such as Bang Luan grape-fruit characterized by big size and yellow skin, hybrid plumose with big size and sour taste; La Hoang pomelo; and Suu pomelo is a rare breed and the first option of connoisseurs.
Perhaps, what makes Doan Hung pomelo special is its extraordinary fragrance.
During Tet holiday the fragrance of Doan Hung grape-fruit displayed in ancestors' altar can inspire a cozy family atmosphere.
Moreover, the pomelo planting has been improving people living standard. Each fruit sent to every corner of the country represents the heart and soul of pomelo growers.
So Doan Hung Pomelo has a unique taste of simplicity but specialty.
Hong Hac (Hac Persimmon), a specialty of the ancestor land, was famous for being ranked in the first of five kinds of rare fruits dedicated to kings long ago.
Hong Hac is a pride of the ancestor land's people.
So far, many persimmon gardens in Viet Tri have life-size and hundred-year-old plants.
Unlike other persimmon, Hong Hac are of big size, squares shape, crispiness and sweet taste without seeds.
Newly-picked Hong Hac have first to be soaked in glazed terra-cotta jars with water taken from a stone well in Tien Cat Viet Tri city for three days to make them sweeter and crispier and more yellow.
Hong Hac is simple and natural as manner of the locals.
Cherishing a persimmon and peeling it with a sharp knife, one can feel the sweet fragrance, and elegant taste that seems to inspire the soul.
The freshness, crispiness and sweetness lasts for long time, leaving unforgettable pleasure.
Enjoying Hong Hac in the mid-Autumn party under the moonlight night is a wonderful and remarkable moment.
Among dozens of tea products, Phu Tho people have choosen a simple and natural drink to serve friends and guests. It is Fresh Green Tea.
Talking about the fresh and tonic drink, everyone may suppose it was simply processed.
What you only need to do is to choose some dozens of fresh tea leaves rinsed in water and dip into in to a jar with hot water, and serve after 20 or 30 minutes.
It is right but not enough for the simple but elegant drink.
Observing the way of enjoying fresh green tea of people here, we can under-stand the “tradition” of the gastronomy.
Choosing the tea plant for fresh green tea drink must be done with care.
To ensure the fine color and scent and sweet-harsh taste, you should choose tea plants growing in a hustle with others plants in forests.
The feet of trees are rough and as big as a house column, and leaves are sometimes too high to be picked.
If you like harsh taste, you should choose the trees growing in areas of sunlight. While, if you like sweet taste, the trees under shadow is the option.
The best tea leaves are yellowish, with stable stems.
Water making the fresh green tea is also selected proper resource.
There is something mysterious, each village has only one water source for making tea. It is called Gieng Que (homeland well).
The fresh green tea connoisseurs use terra-cotta kettles to cooking tealeaves and cork the spout to avoid overflowing quintessence.
Sipping fresh green tea while chatting with friends is to ease the thirst during hard-working days, to feel home when being homesick and make the sweet-and-harsh taste in our memory forever.

Danang Tourism Logo &amp; Slogan
The main creation idea is the stylization of 2 letters D and N, first letters of Da Nang.
The logo’s parts are created by sturdily rising lines and lively colors to represent the idea of the variety and young vitality of Danang.
To increase the visual efficiency, logo is embossed with split lines.
The embossment can be clearly perceived at a distance observation.
Clear-cut features in the creation confirm the idea of the strong development of Danang.
5 parts in logo represent for 5 mountains of Marble Mountains.
As a famous landscape, Marble Mountains deserves one of the most meaningful symbols for Danang tourism.
5 parts with 5 bright colors showcase the young, dynamic city.
Each color represents one feature of Danang tourism.
Green symbolizes for the purity and the natural diversity.
Yellow and orange show the tropical sunlight sparkling on waves, on sand.
Red and purple mean the beauty of enthusiasm and friendliness of Danang people.
And blue arouse the image of “one of the most luxurious beaches in the world”… The gracefulness of logo’s forming and color is based on the steady platform that is DANANG and slogan “Fantasticity!” to make the perfect whole.
Besides obvious meanings, the logo form arouses the image of sails fill with wind.
Not only do sails heading for the sea represent a picturesque coastal city, but they also symbolize the young vitality and the strong will of development.
That is about Danang in my perception: young, dynamic and blooming.
Overall, the combination of color parts makes a blossom that represents a charming Danang, an auspicious Danang.
This is also a blossom opening in hearts of tourists when they come to Danang.
Danang is neither a heritage destination like Hue, Quang Nam nor a vibrant, bustling tourist city like Nha Trang but with the sustainable development strategy, the city is building up values of the diversity, the friendliness, the association with heritages, the preservation and consolidation of tradition, the improvement of living standards…
I have read an article introducing that Danang people seem not know how to marketing for tourism. If you ask Danang people what special things Danang has, they may hesitate to give you answer but they can take care of your journey, let you experience and feel on your own. Therefore, good feelings about Danang naturally sprout in your heart.
What are my good feelings? Well, they are… Charming smiles of visitor supporting team, of tourism pedicab riders are very typical for the friendliness of Danang.
Modern, unique bridges reveal the dynamic development of Danang.
White sandy beaches full of sunshine and undiscorvered virgin forests paint the gorgeous natural picture.
Scattered traditional villages which await to be recovered recall the cultural beauty of Quang Da area … Each part, each color, each beauty felt by tourists when they visit Danang opens a petal of sympathetic flower that would be blooming in their heart once they completely feel Danang’s beauties.
Tourists have to utter a compliment “FantastiCity!” or “Fantastic City!”.
Slogan “FantastiCity!” is the combination of “Fantastic” and “City”.
Because having “C” in common, 2 words are joined together to become 1 strange and interesting word that sounds like a noun.
The slogan is easily understandable.
With an exclamation mark at the end, the slogan “FantastiCity!” is a compliment from satisfied and happy tourists.
Slogan “FantastiCity!” represents the philosophy of Danang tourism: The satisfaction and happiness of tourists for their discovery and experience in the fantastic city.

Pho (noodle soup)
Throughout the country, you can easily find yourselves a hot bowl of pho.
Yet if you are a food expert or you have been getting acquainted to the particular tastes of Hanoi pho, you will find that there is no such pho that can have the flavors of the one served in Hanoi.
The light sweet of the hot broth which floods the white rice noodle having particular flavors of Hanoi will bring you the most satisfying feeling.
rice vermicelli served with snails
Being one of the most famous dishes of Hanoi, bun oc can satisfy people at all ages.
The dish, however, is very simple, containing only rice vermicelli, several snails and the sour broth besides some herbs.

A Hanoi dish that makes people want to try immediately only by hearing its name. For a long time, bun dau mam tom has become a specialty that many people have to try whenever setting feet to the capital city.
A set of bun dau mam tom includes a dish of fresh rice vermicelli, fried tofu, shrimp paste mixed with lemon or kumquat juice, raw vegetables, and boiled pork. Some restaurants even add fried fish paste to the set. It will be a big mistake if visitors to Hanoi skip bun dau mam tom.

A popular street food of Hanoi which is favored by many people. It is not difficult for you to find a bistro or restaurant selling banh da cua at a reasonable cost.
It is a delicious dish with many positive points as it is easy to taste and it neither makes your stomach heavy nor causes you to get tired of eating the food.
The crab noodle soup is normally served with cha lua (Vietnam’s pork sausage), boiled water spinach, bean sprouts, mingled in the mouthwatering aroma of fried shallots and the greasy taste of roasted peanuts.
deep fried fermented pork, grilled fermented pork
Although being considered snack, nem chua is indeed the one-and-only specialty of Hanoi.
If the grilled one has an eye-catching yellow color along with a delicious greasy taste, the fried one has a pink color and brings eaters wonderful flavors created from a combination of pork meat and pigskin.
The two dishes can be found at many restaurants but it is recommended that you should come to the bistro at 36 Tam Thuong Street, Hang Gai Ward, Hoan Kiem District to taste the best fried fermented pork of Hanoi and visit the restaurant at 10 Au Trieu Street in Hoan Kiem District to have the most tasty grilled fermented pork of the capital city.

Appearing in the capital city for several years now, the mixed tofu sweet soup has quickly become a favorite snack to reduce the heat in hot days of young people in Hanoi.
Normally, a bowl of mixed tofu sweet soup includes lotus seed, red bean, jelly, and dried copra. All of those ingredients will then be flooded with the syrup which has the fragrance of jasmine and the greasy coconut milk.
Trang Tien ice cream
The ice cream which for years has “enchanted” so many food lovers.
Trang Tien ice cream is famous for its particular flavors and a quality that cannot be mistaken for any ice cream product of other brands. Speaking of Trang Tien ice cream, people would remember the greasy taste of mung bean, the aroma smell of green rice, the sweet taste of milk chocolate and the light sweet of coconut milk. What makes Trang Tien ice cream a satisfying snack is its cost, which is especially reasonable.

For International tourists who are interested in Responsible tours.
In May 2nd 2014, Vietravel organized a responsible tour to Cu Chi for a group of teachers and students coming from Australia.
The group also visited the old battlefield in Long Tan commune, Dat Do district, Ba Ria Vung Tau province.
Many foreign tourists have special concerns about Responsible tours as they could do something to contribute for the local residents.
Responsible tours give tourists new emotional experiences in their life.
The group of 25 Australian teachers and students came to Vietnam to learn about Vietnamese history and carried out numerous charity activities.
The group visited Thien Phuoc house, which is home of disabled children, at Hamlet 6, An Nhon Tay commune, Cu Chi Dist, Ho Chi Minh city.
They also met and helped blinded children and students from a school named Nhat Hong in HCM city center.
In the evening, the group had dinner at KOTO restaurant where street kids are given opportunities to be trained for cooking and serving in a restaurant, to get ready for their future.
Just within some days, the group have connected all three humanity destinations together and made their tour so meaningful.
In the 14-day-long journey, the Australian students also spent time at the Old battlefield at Long Tan commune, Ba Ria Vung Tau Province which used to be a garrisoned place of Australian army during the Vietnam war.
They visited Long Tan Monument, Long Phuoc underground to experience and see the pictures of the old war in underground commander station, emergency stations and battlefield.
Long Tan battlefield is one of the favorite destinations for Australian tourists.
Besides, the worldwide famous Cu Chi tunnels were also visited as they could give them clear ideas of how severe the war was and how brave and creative the Vietnamese guerillas were in the war.
The tour “Visiting the old battlefield” seems not only for veterans but also for pupils, students- a young generation who don’t know much about wars happening in the past. They come to learn about the history of Vietnam, and the most important thing is to love the peace gained from harsh fighting in wars.
It is the purpose why Vietravel have designed numerous responsible tours to many historical places in Vietnam, which are the milestones in the country’s history.

In the chilly cold weather of the 28 December 2012, the tourist group of Vietravel consisting of many expats has arrived at Ta Phin Junior School, Sapa District to bring aids to the children here.
This is the first departure in the program called “Spring for Compassion” by Vietravel.

In the recent snowfall, Ta Phin was one of the villages suffering badly. Poor children did not have good sweaters to go to school, many had to skip classes and stay home as outside was too cold.
Mr. Ha Tien Dung, Principal of Ta Phin Junior School said there had been some philanthropists who conducted activities at the school.
The visit of Vietravel group was much appreciated and the support was meaningful as it helped poor children to keep their schooling uninterrupted through the cold winter.
For many years, Vietravel always pay a close attention to charity work at poor villages in the mountain province of Lao Cai, specially the district of Sapa, Muong Khuong and Simacai.
Combining travel and charity is a solution to socialize charity and community sharing, where the travel company and its tourists join hands to give aids to people in need during a trip. This is one of the objectives that Vietravel is aiming at.
The company hoped there would be more tourists joining the program and more support reaching children and people in Lao Cai.

CELEBRATION NIGHT OF VIETRAVEL’S 18TH ANNIVERSARY (20 DEC 1995 – 20 DEC 2013)
On 20 December 2013, in the event of Vietravel’s 18th Anniversary, many activities have taken place in Vietravel offices nationwide.
In HCM City, hundreds of Vietravel staff have had a special night of gathering.
Following is a series of photo reporting this meaningful event.
Congratulations to Vietravel, 18 years of continuous effort by generations of management and workers.
Hundreds of staff and managers gathered at the event in family spirit.
Raising voice in the song "Vietravel We are one - We are the one, ready for any challenge to be the pioneer.

VIETRAVEL’S PRIDE: 18 YEAR JOURNEY TO SUCCESS
At the age of 18, Vietravel is filled with the energy of a growing youth who is living up to the mission of contributing for a better community, living up to the responsibility of self-improvement for the satisfaction of tourists.
The 18 year journey of Vietravel is a dream for any business, not only for how fast the company has grown or for the honorable national and international awards, but for the success in conquering the hearts of hundreds of thousands tourists for a sustainable development.
Vietravel and the mission of a pioneer.
Anyone would say a new road will be full of hardship, challenges and chances of failure. However, where there is a will there is a way. Set your heart and go all out for it, you will finally overcome the obstacles to arrive at the finish line.
Vietravel set its heart to be a pioneer and marched on its course with unsurpassed determination and steaming energy in its veins.
Starting with 10 million VND, Vietravel scored 55 billion of sales in 2000, 370 billion in 2005 and accessed the leading position of Vietnam’s tourism industry with 1,480 billion in 2010. Records were set to be hit: 2,000 billion of sales in 2011, 2,500 billion in 2012 and, the company is trying to hit 3,000 billion for 2013.
Numbers are only numbers, but growing 300,000 times bigger in 18 years is really something to admire.
The success came from smart strategy of market development in all domestic, outbound and inbound travel; the continuous expansion of the retail network facilitating the direct contact with tourists; a flexible product policy; and especially the uncompromising commitment to service quality and professionalism.
If the history were converted to a screenplay, the director could have to spend a lot of thoughts on how to depict the rugged journey of a pioneer who put on his own shoulders a great mission. The company is striving for professionalism, while continuously utilizing its competitive strengths to ensure inspiration and added values for its customers.
Generations of employees join the company one after another, but together they made Vietravel a big family with love and sharing.
No one ever complained about the hardship as they all understood that was where they should get better than what they were.
If it was a midnight arrival, the tourguide wouldn’t mind leaving home and rushing through late streets to pick up the tourists. He had to count on his family members who took care of the family when he was away. There were sales reps that burst out in tears when she received a compliment from her customers. There were evenings when one could have been at home for dinner, but many managers and employees still worked at their desk to get the job done.
That sacrifice has been rewarded when the company received honorable titles and recognitions from tourists, the media, the industry authorities and the government.
Have a look back. The last 18 years were a series of adversities, from the economy crisis in the region in 1997, the bird flu epidemic in the next years, and the worldwide crisis which swept away a great number of businesses. Somehow, Vietravel was able to withstand the profound recession thanks to its all out effort and the collective strength of the management and the staff.
The success was beyond expectation. Vietravel possesses priceless assets that any other company must covet: a strong team, a strong customer base and a strong business culture.
More than 1,000 employees are committed to the mission: responsibility towards the environment and the community. This army is marching to its target from little things that contribute to the mission and it has a strong support from the customers as the foothold for to realize its goals.
Vietravel - Customer oriented philosophy and the art of listening
Looking at things from the angle of its customers and listening to the demand, Vietravel was always trusted by the customers.
After 18 years of hard work, Vietravel has become not only the flagship of Vietnam tourism industry but also taken a part in promoting the image of Vietnam tourism to a new height with new goals and mission.
One after another, new offices of Vietravel has been springing up inside and outside Vietnam.
Vietravel was able to establish its brandname even in Cambodia, Thailand, USA. By 2013, Vietravel has expanded the network to as many as 47 offices nationwide from Lao Cai to Ca Mau.
The challenges in a larger playground have been defined, on the other hand, a thousand staff of Vietravel are firm with their course, striving to become Vietnam’s first multi-national travel company in 2015 and one of top ten leading tour operators in Asia by 2020.
To reinforce its commitment, in 2011 Vietravel made a breakthrough achievement and became one of the top 16 leading tour operators in Asia, winner of TTG Awards.
In the next 2 consecutive years 2012 &amp; 2013 Vietravel continued to receive the title “Best Travel Agency – Vietnam” from TTG.
On top of that, Vietravel became the first and only travel company in Vietnam who won the World Travel Awards 2013.
The greater the honor, the greater the responsibility to maintain its leading position and the values that make the company as it is now: professionalism, inspiration, added values.
If one thinks about top 10 most significant events of Vietnam tourism industry in 2013, Vietravel deserved to be the owner of one among those.
Vietravel has arrived at the beautiful age of 18, energetic and matured enough to write up extraordinary stories for Vietnam tourism.
Happy birthday to Vietravel. The pioneer will always be the leader representing the pride of Vietnam, the pride of Vietravel.
